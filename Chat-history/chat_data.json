Here are some steps you can follow:\\n\\n1. **Install NEAR CLI**: The NEAR CLI is a command-line interface that helps you interact with the NEAR blockchain. You can install it using npm:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm install -g near-cli\\n    ```\\n\\n2. **Create a new NEAR account**: You can create a new NEAR account using the NEAR Wallet. You can create it here: [https://wallet.near.org/create](https://wallet.near.org/create)\\n\\n3. **Start a new Project**: Start a new project by creating a new directory and initializing it with `npm init`. Then you can install the NEAR SDK:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm install near-sdk-as\\n    ```\\n\\n4. **Writing a Smart Contract**: In NEAR, smart contracts can be written in Rust. Here's a basic example:\\n\\n    ```rust\\n    use near_sdk::near_bindgen;\\n\\n    #[near_bindgen]\\n    struct DeFiContract {\\n        // your contract fields here\\n    }\\n\\n    #[near_bindgen]\\n    impl DeFiContract {\\n        #[init]\\n        pub fn new() -> Self {\\n            Self {\\n                // initialize your fields here\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // your contract methods here\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n5. **Deploying the Smart Contract**: After writing your smart contract, you can deploy it to the NEAR testnet or mainnet using NEAR CLI. You need to login to your NEAR account, compile your smart contract, and then deploy it:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near login\\n    ```\\n\\n    Compile your smart contract:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n    ```\\n\\n    Deploy your smart contract:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.wasm --accountId my.testnet\\n    ```\\n\\n6. **Building a Frontend**: You can build a frontend for your project using any JavaScript framework like React, Vue, etc. and use the NEAR Javascript API to interact with the blockchain.\\n\\n7. **Test your Project**: You should test your project thoroughly before deploying it to mainnet. You can write tests using the NEAR SDK's testing utilities.\\n\\nRemember, building a DeFi project requires a good understanding of financial concepts and smart contract security. Always make sure to get your smart contracts audited before deploying them to mainnet."

                "content": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to guide you through building your first NEAR app! We'll break down the process into clear steps.\\n\\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\\n\\nFirst, ensure you have `Node.js` installed (we recommend the latest stable version). Then, install `yarn` if you haven't already, as it's a faster package manager. \\n\\nOpen your terminal and run:\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g yarn\\n```\\n\\nNext, install NEAR CLI, which is a command line interface that allows you to interact with the NEAR blockchain easily:\\n```bash\\nyarn global add near-cli\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Create a NEAR Project\\n\\nFor creating a new project, we'll use the `create-near-app`. This command sets up everything you need for a NEAR project.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-near-app@latest your-awesome-project\\n```\\nReplace `your-awesome-project` with the name of your project. This command creates a new directory with all the files you need.\\n\\n### Step 3: Explore the Project Structure\\n\\nNavigate into your project directory:\\n```bash\\ncd your-awesome-project\\n```\\n\\nYou'll find several key directories and files:\\n- `src`: Contains your smart contract code (usually in AssemblyScript or Rust).\\n- `frontend`: Contains the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).\\n- `config.js`: Configuration for your project.\\n\\n### Step 4: Write Your Smart Contract\\n\\nLet's focus on Rust for your smart contract. Navigate to the `src` directory and you'll find a Rust project setup. We will replace the existing example with a simple contract that stores messages.\\n\\nIn the `src/lib.rs`, replace the content with the following:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\nuse near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env};\\n\\n#[near_bindgen]\\n#[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\npub struct Greeter {\\n    messages: Vec<String>,\\n}\\n\\n#[near_bindgen]\\nimpl Greeter {\\n    pub fn add_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n        self.messages.push(message);\\n        let log_message = format!(\\\"Message added successfully!\\\");\\n        env::log(log_message.as_bytes());\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn get_messages(&self) -> Vec<String> {\\n        return self.messages.clone();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis smart contract has two methods: one for adding a message to a vector of messages and another for retrieving the stored messages.\\n\\n### Step 5: Deploy Your Smart Contract\\n\\nTo deploy your smart contract, you first need to build it. Make sure you're in the root directory of your project and run:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn build:release\\n```\\n\\nThen, you need to login to your NEAR account (or create one if you haven't already):\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nFollow the instructions in the terminal to authorize your account. Once done, you can deploy your contract using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --wasmFile out/main.wasm --accountId your-account.testnet\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-account.testnet` with your NEAR account name.\\n\\n### Step 6: Interact with Your Smart Contract\\n\\nYou can interact with your smart contract using the NEAR CLI. For example, to add a message, you can use:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear call your-account.testnet add_message '{\\\"message\\\":\\\"Hello, NEAR!\\\"}' --accountId your-account.testnet\\n```\\n\\nTo retrieve messages:\\n```bash\\nnear view your-account.testnet get_messages\\n```\\n\\n### Step 7: Develop the Frontend\\n\\nNow, head over to the `frontend` directory. Here you can edit the `src/index.html` and `src/index.js` to interact with your smart contract from the web.\\n\\nThis is an overview of building a simple NEAR app. There are many more features and functionalities you can explore with NEAR. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!"

                "content": "Certainly! Let's dive deeper into Step 4, focusing on writing a smart contract in Rust for a NEAR application, aiming to explain the concepts in a way that's accessible to someone technically minded but not necessarily a developer.\\n\\n### Understanding Rust and Smart Contracts\\n\\n**Rust:** It's a programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but it's designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.\\n\\n**Smart Contracts:** These are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically operate as a digital agreement that is enforced by the specific rules it's programmed with.\\n\\n### Breaking Down the Example Contract\\n\\nThe example provided is a simple smart contract written in Rust designed for the NEAR blockchain. It allows users to store messages and retrieve them. Let's dissect it:\\n\\n#### Importing Libraries\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\nuse near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env};\\n```\\n\\n- `near_sdk`: This is the NEAR software development kit. It provides the necessary tools and components to build smart contracts on NEAR.\\n- `borsh`: This is a module for serialization and deserialization. Serialization is converting data structures or object states into a format that can be stored or transmitted and \\\"revived\\\" later. We use it here for data persistence.\\n- `near_bindgen`: A macro that prepares your code for the NEAR blockchain, making the defined struct accessible to the blockchain.\\n\\n#### Defining the Contract Structure\\n\\n```rust\\n#[near_bindgen]\\n#[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\npub struct Greeter {\\n    messages: Vec<String>,\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- `#[near_bindgen]`: This attribute indicates that the following struct is intended to be compiled into a smart contract.\\n- `#[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]`: This automatically implements traits which are Rust\u2019s way of sharing method definitions. Here, it's for serialization (`BorshSerialize`) and deserialization (`BorshDeserialize`), and `Default` for default struct initialization.\\n- `pub struct Greeter`: Defines a structure named `Greeter`. Structures are similar to classes in other languages; they're used to encapsulate data.\\n- `messages: Vec<String>`: This is a field within the `Greeter` struct. `Vec<String>` denotes a dynamic array (vector) of strings. Here, it's used to store the messages.\\n\\n#### Implementing Contract Methods\\n\\n```rust\\nimpl Greeter {\\n    pub fn add_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n        self.messages.push(message);\\n        let log_message = format!(\\\"Message added successfully!\\\");\\n        env::log(log_message.as_bytes());\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn get_messages(&self) -> Vec<String> {\\n        return self.messages.clone();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- `impl Greeter`: This is implementing methods for the `Greeter` struct.\\n- `pub fn add_message(&mut self, message: String)`: A public function that allows the addition of a message to the `messages` vector. `&mut self` means it mutably borrows `self`, so it can modify its data.\\n  - `self.messages.push(message)`: Adds the input message to the `messages` vector.\\n  - `env::log(log_message.as_bytes())`: Logs a message to the console. Useful for debugging and provides transparency of actions on the blockchain.\\n- `pub fn get_messages(&self) -> Vec<String>`: A function to retrieve all messages. `&self` means it borrows `self` immutably, so no data is changed during the function execution. It returns a vector of strings.\\n\\n### Deploying and Interacting with the Contract\\n\\nAfter writing the contract, it would be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) and then deployed to the NEAR blockchain. Users can interact with it by calling its methods, allowing them to add and retrieve messages.\\n\\nThis example encapsulates fundamental concepts of smart contract development on NEAR and introduces you to Rust syntax, blockchain data persistence, and the interaction model of smart contracts."

This assumes you have a text editor installed (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.) and basic file navigation knowledge in your operating system. Here\u2019s how you can do it for a Rust project, specifically within the context of developing a NEAR smart contract:\\n\\n### Step 1: Locate `src/lib.rs`\\n\\nFirst, you need to find the `src/lib.rs` file within your project's directory. This file is conventionally the main source file for Rust libraries and, by extension, NEAR smart contracts since they're developed as Rust packages.\\n\\n- Open your project folder.\\n- Navigate to the `src` directory.\\n- Locate the `lib.rs` file.\\n\\n### Step 2: Open `lib.rs` in a Text Editor\\n\\nNext, you need to open this file in your preferred text editor. If you have a graphical interface, you can usually do this by right-clicking the file and selecting \\\"Open with\\\" followed by your editor of choice. Alternatively, you can open the editor first and use its file navigation features to open `lib.rs`.\\n\\n### Step 3: Replace the Content\\n\\nOnce the file is open:\\n\\n1. **Select All**: Use the shortcut `Ctrl+A` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+A` on macOS to select all the content currently in `lib.rs`.\\n2. **Delete**: Press `Delete` or `Backspace` to remove the current content.\\n3. **Paste the New Code**: Copy the new Rust code provided to you or that you have ready. Click inside the now-empty `lib.rs` file and paste the code using `Ctrl+V` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+V` on macOS.\\n\\nThe new code you're pasting would typically define the structure and functionality of your smart contract, as discussed or provided in earlier steps.\\n\\n### Step 4: Save the File\\n\\nAfter replacing the content with the new code snippet, make sure to save the file. You can usually do this by clicking \\\"File\\\" > \\\"Save\\\" in your editor's menu or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+S` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+S` on macOS.\\n\\n### Step 5: Verify and Proceed\\n\\nIt's good practice to briefly go through the file and ensure the new code looks correct and is free of syntax errors. Most text editors with Rust support will highlight syntax errors or warnings.\\n\\nNow that you've replaced the content in `src/lib.rs`, you can proceed with compiling or building your project, as required by your development workflow for the NEAR smart contract.\\n\\nIf you encounter any errors or need further assistance with the code or steps, feel free to ask more specific questions!"

This means that the Zsh shell (which is the default shell on macOS and available on other Unix-like operating systems) cannot find the `yarn` executable when you try to run a command with it.\\n\\nHere's why you might be seeing this error and how you can resolve it:\\n\\n### 1. Yarn Is Not Installed\\n\\nIf you haven't installed Yarn on your system, you'll need to do so before you can use it.\\n\\n**Installation Steps:**\\n\\nYarn can be installed in several ways, including via the npm package manager (which comes with Node.js), the Homebrew package manager on macOS, or Yarn's Debian or RPM packages for Linux.\\n\\nTo install Yarn using npm:\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global yarn\\n```\\n\\nTo install Yarn using Homebrew on macOS:\\n```bash\\nbrew install yarn\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** If you install Yarn using npm, make sure Node.js is installed on your system. For Homebrew, ensure Homebrew is set up and updated.\\n\\n### 2. Yarn Is Not in Your PATH\\n\\nIf Yarn is installed, but your shell (zsh in this case) cannot find it, the most likely cause is that Yarn's installation directory is not in your system's PATH. The PATH environment variable is a list of directories that the shell searches through when you enter a command. If the directory containing Yarn isn't listed, the shell won't be able to find and execute it.\\n\\n**Fixing PATH Issues:**\\n\\nTo fix this, you need to add Yarn's executable to your PATH. The method for doing this can vary based on how Yarn was installed and your operating system. Here's how you might do it for a common Yarn installation via npm:\\n\\n1. **Find where Yarn was installed**: Running `npm list -g yarn` can help you locate it.\\n2. **Add Yarn to your PATH**: You'll need to edit your `.zshrc` file (since you're using zsh as your shell). Open this file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing `/path/to/yarn` with the actual path to Yarn's directory:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport PATH=\\\"$PATH:/path/to/yarn\\\"\\n```\\n\\n3. **Apply the changes**: Run `source ~/.zshrc` or simply restart your terminal to apply the changes.\\n\\n### 3. Installation Wasn't Successful\\n\\nIf you attempted to install Yarn but the installation wasn't successful, you might still see this error. Review the installation steps to ensure they were completed without error. Checking the installation logs might provide insights into what went wrong.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\nAfter resolving the issue, running `yarn build:release` should initiate the build process for your project without showing the `command not found` error. If you encounter any other issues, ensure that your project dependencies are correctly configured to use Yarn and that there are no other environment-specific issues."

                "content": "Given the command line dialogue you've provided, it seems like you've encountered a couple of key issues in deploying your smart contract and managing your development environment. Let's address them:\\n\\n### 1. NEAR CLI Command Not Found\\n\\nThe error message `./deploy.sh: line 2: near: command not found` suggests that the NEAR CLI is not properly installed or not found in your system's PATH. Despite attempting to install NEAR CLI using npm, it appears that there was a conflict because a file named `near` already exists in your npm global bin directory. This conflict prevented the installation from completing successfully.\\n\\n### 2. Yarn Command Not Found\\n\\nSimilarly, the `zsh: command not found: yarn` error indicates that Yarn is either not installed or not included in your system's PATH. This problem persists even after you attempted to install Yarn globally through npm.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n#### Fixing NEAR CLI Installation\\n\\nFirst, let's address the NEAR CLI installation issue. You encountered an error because an existing `near` file is in your npm global bin directory, preventing the installation. You can try to force the installation using the `--force` flag with npm or manually remove the existing `near` file before installation.\\n\\nTo force reinstall NEAR CLI, you can run:\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global near-cli --force\\n```\\n\\nOr, delete the existing `near` binary and then reinstall NEAR CLI:\\n```bash\\nrm /Users/beccawilliams/.npm-global/bin/near\\nnpm install --global near-cli\\n```\\n\\nAfter installation, ensure that the npm global bin directory is in your PATH. Add it to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:\\n```bash\\nexport PATH=\\\"$PATH:/Users/beccawilliams/.npm-global/bin\\\"\\n```\\nThen, source your profile or restart the terminal:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nor for Bash:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.bash_profile\\n```\\n\\n#### Fixing Yarn Installation\\n\\nFor Yarn, you attempted to install it globally after encountering the command not found error, but it seems there was an issue recognizing the installation. Ensure that Yarn's installation path is added to your system's PATH.\\n\\nYarn provides documentation on how to configure the PATH after a global installation. Typically, adding Yarn to your PATH involves adding a line similar to the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:\\n```bash\\nexport PATH=\\\"$PATH:`yarn global bin`\\\"\\n```\\nAfter modifying your shell configuration file, apply the changes:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nor for Bash:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.bash_profile\\n```\\n\\n### General Advice\\n\\n- After making changes to the PATH or installing command-line tools, it's a good practice to open a new terminal window to ensure that all changes are applied.\\n- Ensure that the scripts (like `deploy.sh`) you're executing have the correct permissions and that any commands within them are accessible from your PATH.\\n\\nThis should resolve the issues with both the NEAR CLI and Yarn not being found. If you continue to encounter problems, double-check the installation steps and ensure there are no typos in your PATH configuration."

It indicates that 23 of the packages (dependencies) installed as part of your command have included metadata expressing that they are seeking financial contributions to support their development.\\n\\nThis information is included in the package's `package.json` file under a `funding` field, which usually contains a URL pointing to a place where you can learn more about how to fund the project's development, such as a Patreon page, Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors profile, or another crowdfunding platform.\\n\\n### Why Do Packages Seek Funding?\\n\\nOpen-source projects often rely on the community for support. Maintaining a project can require a significant amount of time and resources. Funding helps maintainers:\\n\\n- Dedicate more time to develop new features and maintain existing ones\\n- Cover costs associated with development, such as hosting or software licenses\\n- Support the project's sustainability and growth over time\\n\\n### How to Respond to the Message\\n\\nIf you or your organization heavily relies on certain open-source packages, consider following the links provided in the funding messages to see if there's a way you can contribute financially. Supporting open-source projects can help ensure their longevity and improve the tools you rely on.\\n\\n### How to See Funding Requests\\n\\nIf you want to see which packages are requesting funding after you've installed packages, you can use specific commands to list them:\\n\\nFor npm (version 6.13.0 and later), you can run:\\n```bash\\nnpm fund\\n```\\n\\nFor Yarn, as of my last update, Yarn does not have a built-in command similar to `npm fund`, but you can manually check the `package.json` files of your dependencies for funding information.\\n\\nRemember, contributing to open-source is not only about funding. Contributing code, reporting bugs, helping with documentation, and engaging with the community are also valuable ways to support open-source projects."

If you're comfortable with `nano`, you can type:\\n   ```bash\\n   nano ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n   \\n3. **Add the npm global bin directory to your PATH.** First, you need to find out where npm has set the global bin directory. You can do this by running:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm bin -g\\n   ```\\n   It will output a path, something like `/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin`. You need to add this path to your PATH variable by adding the following line at the end of your `~/.zshrc` file:\\n   ```bash\\n   export PATH=\\\"$PATH:/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Make sure to replace `/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin` with the actual path you got from `npm bin -g`.\\n\\n4. **Save your changes and exit the editor.** If you're using `nano`, you can press `Ctrl+O`, `Enter` to save, and then `Ctrl+X` to exit.\\n\\n5. **Apply the changes.** To make sure your current terminal session uses the updated PATH, source your `~/.zshrc` file by running:\\n   ```bash\\n   source ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n\\n### For Bash Users\\n\\nThe process is similar if you're using Bash instead of Zsh.\\n\\n1. **Open your terminal.**\\n\\n2. **Open your `~/.bash_profile` file in a text editor.** If you're on a system that uses `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`, open that file instead. Using `nano`:\\n   ```bash\\n   nano ~/.bash_profile\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Add the npm global bin directory to your PATH.** Find the path with `npm bin -g` as described above, then add the following line to `~/.bash_profile`:\\n   ```bash\\n   export PATH=\\\"$PATH:/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Ensure you replace the path with the correct one for your setup.\\n\\n4. **Save and exit the text editor.**\\n\\n5. **Apply the changes by sourcing your profile.** For `.bash_profile`:\\n   ```bash\\n   source ~/.bash_profile\\n   ```\\n\\nAfter following these steps, your terminal will recognize commands for globally installed npm packages. You can confirm that a package is correctly found in the PATH by typing its name into the terminal and pressing Enter. If it runs, you've successfully added it to your PATH."

Here's how you can locate and edit your `~/.zshrc` file:\\n\\n### Using Terminal to Open `~/.zshrc`\\n\\n1. **Open Terminal**: Start by opening a Terminal window.\\n\\n2. **Check if `~/.zshrc` Exists**: Before trying to open the `~/.zshrc` file, you might want to check if it exists since it's not always created by default. Run:\\n   ```bash\\n   ls -la ~ | grep .zshrc\\n   ```\\n   This command lists all files in your home directory (`~`), including hidden ones (`-a` flag), and then filters (`grep`) for `.zshrc`. If you see `.zshrc` in the output, the file exists.\\n\\n3. **Open `~/.zshrc` with a Text Editor**: You can use any text editor that you're comfortable with. Common command-line editors include `nano`, `vim`, and `emacs`. To open the file with `nano`, for example, run:\\n   ```bash\\n   nano ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n   If you prefer a graphical text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.), and it's installed on your system, you can typically open the file directly from the terminal as well.

For instance, using `nano`:\\n```bash\\nnano ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nAs soon as you save changes to this new file, it will be created.\\n\\n### Applying Changes\\n\\nAfter editing and saving changes to your `~/.zshrc` file, you'll need to reload it for the changes to take effect in your current terminal session. You can do this by running:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nor, equivalently:\\n```bash\\n. ~/.zshrc\\n```\\n\\nThis command executes the `~/.zshrc` file, applying any changes you've made. If you open a new terminal window or tab, it will automatically load the updated configuration without needing to manually source it."

This file is essential for defining various attributes about a Node.js project, including its dependencies, scripts, and more. The `yarn build:release` command you're trying to run is likely a script defined within a `package.json` file of a specific project.\\n\\nTo resolve this issue, make sure you're executing the `yarn build:release` command in the correct directory where your project's `package.json` file is located. Here's what you should do:\\n\\n1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change directories to your project's root directory where the `package.json` file is located. For example, if your project is located in `/Users/beccawilliams/my_project`, you would run:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd /Users/beccawilliams/my_project\\n   ```\\n   Replace `/Users/beccawilliams/my_project` with the actual path to your project directory.\\n\\n2. **Verify `package.json` Exists**: Once in the correct directory, verify that a `package.json` file exists by listing the contents of the directory with:\\n   ```bash\\n   ls -l\\n   ```\\n   You should see `package.json` listed among the files.\\n\\n3. **Run the Command Again**: With the `package.json` file present in your current directory, try running the `yarn build:release` command again:\\n   ```bash\\n   yarn build:release\\n   ```\\n\\nThis command should now execute successfully, assuming that \\\"build:release\\\" is a script defined within your `package.json` file. Scripts in `package.json` are typically defined in the \\\"scripts\\\" section, like so:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"build:release\\\": \\\"your-build-command-here\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nMake sure the `build:release` script exists in your `package.json` file. If it doesn't, or if you're following instructions from a tutorial or documentation, ensure you've set up your project according to those guidelines, including any necessary scripts in your `package.json`."

Once there, use `ls` or `dir` (on Windows) to list the files and check for `package.json`.\\n\\n2. **Your Project is Not Initialized**: If this is a new project or if you've never run `npm init` or `yarn init`, you won't have a `package.json` file. This file is critical for managing project dependencies with NPM or Yarn and for defining project-specific tasks (like `yarn build:release`).\\n\\n### How to Initialize Your Project\\n\\nIf you're starting a new project or if your existing project doesn't have a `package.json` file, you can easily create this file by initializing your project with npm or Yarn. Here's how:\\n\\n#### Using npm\\n\\n1. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd path/to/your/project\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Run the following command:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm init\\n   ```\\n   \\n3. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions about your project (like its name, version, description). You can press Enter to accept default values or input your own. Once completed, a `package.json` file will be created in your project directory.\\n\\n#### Using Yarn\\n\\n1. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd path/to/your/project\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Run the following command:\\n   ```bash\\n   yarn init\\n   ```\\n   \\n3. Similar to `npm init`, you'll be prompted to answer questions about your project. Once you've answered them (or accepted the defaults), Yarn will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.\\n\\n### Adding a Script to package.json\\n\\nAfter initializing your project and creating a `package.json` file, you can add custom scripts to it. For example, to add a `build:release` script, you would:\\n\\n1. Open `package.json` in a text editor.\\n2. Locate (or add) the `\\\"scripts\\\"` section.\\n3. Add your `build:release` script as follows:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n     \\\"build:release\\\": \\\"your-command-here\\\"\\n   }\\n   ```\\n   Replace `\\\"your-command-here\\\"` with the actual command you wish to run when you execute `yarn build:release`.\\n\\n4. Save your changes to `package.json`.\\n\\nNow, when you run `yarn build:release` in your terminal (while in your project's root directory), Yarn will execute the command you specified in the `build:release` script."

However, I can guide you on how you might approach creating a tool or script to fetch and display such information in a table format, assuming you have access to a source of data that lists projects on NEAR.\\n\\nLet's assume you have a JSON file or an API that returns data about projects building on NEAR. The data might look something like this in JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Project One\\\",\\n    \\\"website\\\": \\\"https://projectone.com\\\",\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"DeFi\\\",\\n    \\\"number_of_users\\\": 5000\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Project Two\\\",\\n    \\\"website\\\": \\\"https://projecttwo.com\\\",\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"NFT Marketplace\\\",\\n    \\\"number_of_users\\\": 3000\\n  }\\n  // Add more projects as needed\\n]\\n```\\n\\nYou can write a simple JavaScript script to display this data in a table format on a webpage.

Assuming the contract has a view method to get the list of members, you could use NEAR's JavaScript SDK to make this call. \\n\\nFirst, ensure you have the contract's account ID and know the correct method name for fetching the members. \\n\\nHere's a basic example of how you might do this using JavaScript:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst { connect, keyStores, WalletConnection } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\");\\n\\nasync function getMembers() {\\n    // Configuration for the NEAR connection\\n    const nearConfig = {\\n        networkId: \\\"mainnet\\\", // or \\\"testnet\\\"\\n        keyStore: new keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),\\n        nodeUrl: \\\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org\\\",\\n        walletUrl: \\\"https://wallet.mainnet.near.org\\\",\\n    };\\n\\n    // Connect to NEAR\\n    const near = await connect(nearConfig);\\n    const wallet = new WalletConnection(near);\\n    \\n    // Assuming you know the contract name and the method\\n    const contractName = \\\"hzn_contract.near\\\"; // Replace with actual contract account\\n    const methodName = \\\"get_members\\\"; // Replace with the actual method name\\n\\n    // Making a contract call to get the data\\n    const members = await wallet.account().viewFunction(contractName, methodName, {});\\n    console.log(members);\\n}\\n\\ngetMembers().catch(console.error);\\n```\\n\\n2. **Blockchain Explorer**: If the project has publicly shared transactions or a smart contract deployment on the NEAR blockchain, you might find information about founders or members in the transaction details on a blockchain explorer for NEAR, like [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/). This would be more manual and less direct than querying a smart contract.\\n\\n3. **Official Project Channels**: Projects often list team members or founders on their official website, whitepaper, or social media channels. If HZN has such resources, they might explicitly list their founding members there.\\n\\nIf \\\"HZN\\\" stands for something specific not related to a project or if there\u2019s another context, could you provide more details? This would help in giving a more accurate response."

The UI itself is hosted in a decentralized manner, aligning with the ethos of blockchain technology, ensuring that the application remains censorship-resistant and in line with decentralization principles.\\n\\nHere are some key points about decentralized UIs, particularly with NEAR:\\n\\n### Hosting on Decentralized Storage:\\n\\n1. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: Many DApps choose to host their front-end UI on IPFS, a peer-to-peer protocol for sharing and storing files in a distributed file system. This ensures that the application's UI is accessible from anywhere without relying on a single server or provider.\\n   \\n2. **Arweave**: Another option is Arweave, a service that offers permanent, tamper-proof storage for DApp front ends. It's a bit different from IPFS in that it focuses on long-term storage, ensuring that the UI remains available indefinitely.\\n\\n3. **NEAR's own solutions**: While NEAR primarily focuses on the underlying blockchain and smart contract technology, it integrates well with decentralized storage solutions for hosting UIs. The NEAR Protocol itself does not provide a decentralized storage layer specifically for UIs, but it supports and encourages using these technologies.\\n\\n### Development Tools and Frameworks:\\n\\n- **Create Near App**: For development, you might use templates like \\\"create-near-app\\\", which scaffold a NEAR project for you. This tool can set up both the smart contract backend (using Rust or AssemblyScript) and a React front-end template that you can modify for your DApp. Once developed, the front-end can then be deployed to a decentralized storage solution of your choice.\\n\\n- **NEAR SDKs**: For the front-end, NEAR offers JavaScript SDKs (`near-api-js`) that facilitate communication between your decentralized UI and the NEAR blockchain, enabling tasks such as contract interactions, wallet integration, and transaction signing.\\n\\n### Example of Decentralized UI Deployment:\\n\\n1. **Develop your DApp UI**: Typically using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For interacting with NEAR, you would use `near-api-js`.\\n\\n2. **Build and bundle your UI**: Tools like Webpack or Parcel can be used to bundle your application for production.\\n\\n3. **Deploy to decentralized storage**: Upload your bundled application to IPFS, Arweave, or another decentralized storage solution.\\n\\n4. **Access through a gateway**: Users can access your DApp UI through public gateways or directly if they have IPFS nodes or compatible browser extensions.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\n\\nA decentralized UI for NEAR DApps ensures that the application remains accessible and resilient against censorship or centralized points of failure. By leveraging decentralized storage solutions for hosting the UI and utilizing NEAR's developer tools for blockchain interactions, developers can create fully decentralized applications that align with blockchain's core principles."

Here are the steps to get you started with your first NEAR dApp.\\n\\n**Step 1: Install Node.js and Yarn**\\n\\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed. If you don't, you can install them using the following commands:\\n\\nFor Node.js:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash\\nnvm install node\\n```\\n\\nFor Yarn:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global yarn\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Install NEAR CLI**\\n\\nThe NEAR CLI (Command Line Interface) is a collection of tools for creating, managing, and deploying to the NEAR platform. Install it using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global near-cli\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Create a new NEAR project**\\n\\nYou can create a new NEAR project using the `create-near-app` command. Replace `my-first-near-app` with the name of your project:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-near-app my-first-near-app\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Explore your project**\\n\\nThe `create-near-app` command will create a new directory named after your project. It includes a frontend (React by default) and a contract directory. The contract directory is where you write your smart contracts in Rust.\\n\\n**Step 5: Write your smart contract**\\n\\nYou can write your smart contract in the `contract/src/lib.rs` file. Here's a simple Rust contract:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\nuse near_sdk::{env, near_bindgen};\\n\\nnear_sdk::setup_alloc!();\\n\\n// Data model\\n#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\npub struct MyContract {\\n    pub message: String,\\n}\\n\\n#[near_bindgen]\\nimpl MyContract {\\n    #[init]\\n    pub fn new(message: String) -> Self {\\n        Self { message }\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn get_message(&self) -> String {\\n        return self.message.clone();\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn set_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n        self.message = message;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Step 6: Build and deploy your smart contract**\\n\\nYou can build your contract using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn build:contract\\n```\\n\\nThen deploy it using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear dev-deploy out/main.wasm\\n```\\n\\n**Step 7: Interact with your smart contract**\\n\\nNow, you can interact with your smart contract via the frontend. Update the `src/config.js` file with the account ID that was printed after deploying your contract.\\n\\nYou can then run your app locally using:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn start\\n```\\n\\nAnd that's it! You've just created your first NEAR dApp. This is a simple example and real-world dApps can be much more complex, but this should help you get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."

It allows the contract owner to create (mint) new tokens and assign them to an owner. Token owners can transfer their tokens to someone else. Anyone can check the owner of a specific token.\\n\\nPlease note that this contract doesn't fully comply with the NEP-171 standards (e.g., it doesn't implement approval functionality, doesn't emit events, etc.), but it should help you get started with NFTs on NEAR.\\n\\nOnce you've written your contract, you can compile it to WebAssembly (WASM) using the Rust compiler. You can then deploy the compiled WASM file to the NEAR testnet or mainnet using the NEAR CLI."

Since your project includes Rust smart contracts, you have the NEAR CLI installed, and you already have a testnet account, we can proceed with deploying your project to the NEAR TestNet. Here's a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n### 1. Compile Your Smart Contract\\n\\nFirst, ensure your Rust smart contract is ready to be compiled. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and use the following command to compile your contract. This will generate a WebAssembly (`.wasm`) file which is what we'll deploy to the NEAR TestNet.\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\nThe compiled `.wasm` file will be located in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`. Ensure you note the name of the `.wasm` file generated.\\n\\n### 2. Log in to Your NEAR TestNet Account via CLI\\n\\nIf you haven't already logged in to your NEAR testnet account through the CLI, do it by running:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nThis command will open a new browser window asking you to log in with your NEAR wallet and authorize the NEAR CLI. Follow the instructions on the screen.\\n\\n### 3. Deploy Your Smart Contract\\n\\nTo deploy your smart contract, use the `near deploy` command, specifying:\\n- Your account ID on the testnet (e.g., `your-account.testnet`)\\n- The path to your compiled `.wasm` file\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId your-account.testnet --wasmFile path/to/your_compiled_contract.wasm\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-account.testnet` with your actual testnet account name and `path/to/your_compiled_contract.wasm` with the path to your compiled `.wasm` file.\\n\\n### 4. Verify Deployment\\n\\nAfter deploying, you can verify that your contract is successfully deployed by calling a view method (a method that does not change state) on your contract. The command will look something like this:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear view your-account.testnet get_some_data '{}'\\n```\\n\\nReplace `get_some_data` with an actual view method from your smart contract and `your-account.testnet` with your testnet account name.\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n\\n- Make sure your account has enough NEAR tokens to cover the deployment gas fees. You can get free NEAR tokens for testing purposes from the [NEAR TestNet Faucet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/).\\n- Always test your smart contract thoroughly in a test environment before considering deploying it to the mainnet.\\n\\nIf you encounter any issues or have specific questions about any of the steps, feel free to ask!"

                "content": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to guide you through building your first NEAR app! We'll break down the process into clear steps.\\n\\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\\n\\nFirst, ensure you have `Node.js` installed (we recommend the latest stable version). Then, install `yarn` if you haven't already, as it's a faster package manager. \\n\\nOpen your terminal and run:\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g yarn\\n```\\n\\nNext, install NEAR CLI, which is a command line interface that allows you to interact with the NEAR blockchain easily:\\n```bash\\nyarn global add near-cli\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Create a NEAR Project\\n\\nFor creating a new project, we'll use the `create-near-app`. This command sets up everything you need for a NEAR project.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-near-app@latest your-awesome-project\\n```\\nReplace `your-awesome-project` with the name of your project. This command creates a new directory with all the files you need.\\n\\n### Step 3: Explore the Project Structure\\n\\nNavigate into your project directory:\\n```bash\\ncd your-awesome-project\\n```\\n\\nYou'll find several key directories and files:\\n- `src`: Contains your smart contract code (usually in AssemblyScript or Rust).\\n- `frontend`: Contains the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).\\n- `config.js`: Configuration for your project.\\n\\n### Step 4: Write Your Smart Contract\\n\\nLet's focus on Rust for your smart contract. Navigate to the `src` directory and you'll find a Rust project setup. We will replace the existing example with a simple contract that stores messages.\\n\\nIn the `src/lib.rs`, replace the content with the following:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\nuse near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env};\\n\\n#[near_bindgen]\\n#[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\npub struct Greeter {\\n    messages: Vec<String>,\\n}\\n\\n#[near_bindgen]\\nimpl Greeter {\\n    pub fn add_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n        self.messages.push(message);\\n        let log_message = format!(\\\"Message added successfully!\\\");\\n        env::log(log_message.as_bytes());\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn get_messages(&self) -> Vec<String> {\\n        return self.messages.clone();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis smart contract has two methods: one for adding a message to a vector of messages and another for retrieving the stored messages.\\n\\n### Step 5: Deploy Your Smart Contract\\n\\nTo deploy your smart contract, you first need to build it. Make sure you're in the root directory of your project and run:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn build:release\\n```\\n\\nThen, you need to login to your NEAR account (or create one if you haven't already):\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nFollow the instructions in the terminal to authorize your account. Once done, you can deploy your contract using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --wasmFile out/main.wasm --accountId your-account.testnet\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-account.testnet` with your NEAR account name.\\n\\n### Step 6: Interact with Your Smart Contract\\n\\nYou can interact with your smart contract using the NEAR CLI. For example, to add a message, you can use:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear call your-account.testnet add_message '{\\\"message\\\":\\\"Hello, NEAR!\\\"}' --accountId your-account.testnet\\n```\\n\\nTo retrieve messages:\\n```bash\\nnear view your-account.testnet get_messages\\n```\\n\\n### Step 7: Develop the Frontend\\n\\nNow, head over to the `frontend` directory. Here you can edit the `src/index.html` and `src/index.js` to interact with your smart contract from the web.\\n\\nThis is an overview of building a simple NEAR app. There are many more features and functionalities you can explore with NEAR.

Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but it's designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.\\n\\n**Smart Contracts:** These are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.

Let's dissect it:\\n\\n#### Importing Libraries\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\nuse near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env};\\n```\\n\\n- `near_sdk`: This is the NEAR software development kit. It provides the necessary tools and components to build smart contracts on NEAR.\\n- `borsh`: This is a module for serialization and deserialization. Serialization is converting data structures or object states into a format that can be stored or transmitted and \\\"revived\\\" later. We use it here for data persistence.\\n- `near_bindgen`: A macro that prepares your code for the NEAR blockchain, making the defined struct accessible to the blockchain.\\n\\n#### Defining the Contract Structure\\n\\n```rust\\n#[near_bindgen]\\n#[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\npub struct Greeter {\\n    messages: Vec<String>,\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- `#[near_bindgen]`: This attribute indicates that the following struct is intended to be compiled into a smart contract.\\n- `#[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]`: This automatically implements traits which are Rust\u2019s way of sharing method definitions. Here, it's for serialization (`BorshSerialize`) and deserialization (`BorshDeserialize`), and `Default` for default struct initialization.\\n- `pub struct Greeter`: Defines a structure named `Greeter`. Structures are similar to classes in other languages; they're used to encapsulate data.\\n- `messages: Vec<String>`: This is a field within the `Greeter` struct. `Vec<String>` denotes a dynamic array (vector) of strings. Here, it's used to store the messages.\\n\\n#### Implementing Contract Methods\\n\\n```rust\\nimpl Greeter {\\n    pub fn add_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n        self.messages.push(message);\\n        let log_message = format!(\\\"Message added successfully!\\\");\\n        env::log(log_message.as_bytes());\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn get_messages(&self) -> Vec<String> {\\n        return self.messages.clone();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- `impl Greeter`: This is implementing methods for the `Greeter` struct.\\n- `pub fn add_message(&mut self, message: String)`: A public function that allows the addition of a message to the `messages` vector. `&mut self` means it mutably borrows `self`, so it can modify its data.\\n  - `self.messages.push(message)`: Adds the input message to the `messages` vector.\\n  - `env::log(log_message.as_bytes())`: Logs a message to the console. Useful for debugging and provides transparency of actions on the blockchain.\\n- `pub fn get_messages(&self) -> Vec<String>`: A function to retrieve all messages. `&self` means it borrows `self` immutably, so no data is changed during the function execution. It returns a vector of strings.\\n\\n### Deploying and Interacting with the Contract\\n\\nAfter writing the contract, it would be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) and then deployed to the NEAR blockchain. Users can interact with it by calling its methods, allowing them to add and retrieve messages.\\n\\nThis example encapsulates fundamental concepts of smart contract development on NEAR and introduces you to Rust syntax, blockchain data persistence, and the interaction model of smart contracts."

                "content": "Replacing the content of `src/lib.rs` with a new code snippet involves a few straightforward steps. This assumes you have a text editor installed (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.) and basic file navigation knowledge in your operating system. Here\u2019s how you can do it for a Rust project, specifically within the context of developing a NEAR smart contract:\\n\\n### Step 1: Locate `src/lib.rs`\\n\\nFirst, you need to find the `src/lib.rs` file within your project's directory. This file is conventionally the main source file for Rust libraries and, by extension, NEAR smart contracts since they're developed as Rust packages.\\n\\n- Open your project folder.\\n- Navigate to the `src` directory.\\n- Locate the `lib.rs` file.\\n\\n### Step 2: Open `lib.rs` in a Text Editor\\n\\nNext, you need to open this file in your preferred text editor. If you have a graphical interface, you can usually do this by right-clicking the file and selecting \\\"Open with\\\" followed by your editor of choice. Alternatively, you can open the editor first and use its file navigation features to open `lib.rs`.\\n\\n### Step 3: Replace the Content\\n\\nOnce the file is open:\\n\\n1. **Select All**: Use the shortcut `Ctrl+A` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+A` on macOS to select all the content currently in `lib.rs`.\\n2. **Delete**: Press `Delete` or `Backspace` to remove the current content.\\n3. **Paste the New Code**: Copy the new Rust code provided to you or that you have ready. Click inside the now-empty `lib.rs` file and paste the code using `Ctrl+V` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+V` on macOS.\\n\\nThe new code you're pasting would typically define the structure and functionality of your smart contract, as discussed or provided in earlier steps.\\n\\n### Step 4: Save the File\\n\\nAfter replacing the content with the new code snippet, make sure to save the file. You can usually do this by clicking \\\"File\\\" > \\\"Save\\\" in your editor's menu or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+S` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+S` on macOS.\\n\\n### Step 5: Verify and Proceed\\n\\nIt's good practice to briefly go through the file and ensure the new code looks correct and is free of syntax errors. Most text editors with Rust support will highlight syntax errors or warnings.\\n\\nNow that you've replaced the content in `src/lib.rs`, you can proceed with compiling or building your project, as required by your development workflow for the NEAR smart contract.\\n\\nIf you encounter any errors or need further assistance with the code or steps, feel free to ask more specific questions!"

                "content": "The error message `zsh: command not found: yarn` occurs because the `yarn` package manager is not installed on your system, or it is not properly added to your system's PATH. This means that the Zsh shell (which is the default shell on macOS and available on other Unix-like operating systems) cannot find the `yarn` executable when you try to run a command with it.\\n\\nHere's why you might be seeing this error and how you can resolve it:\\n\\n### 1. Yarn Is Not Installed\\n\\nIf you haven't installed Yarn on your system, you'll need to do so before you can use it.\\n\\n**Installation Steps:**\\n\\nYarn can be installed in several ways, including via the npm package manager (which comes with Node.js), the Homebrew package manager on macOS, or Yarn's Debian or RPM packages for Linux.\\n\\nTo install Yarn using npm:\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global yarn\\n```\\n\\nTo install Yarn using Homebrew on macOS:\\n```bash\\nbrew install yarn\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** If you install Yarn using npm, make sure Node.js is installed on your system. For Homebrew, ensure Homebrew is set up and updated.\\n\\n### 2. Yarn Is Not in Your PATH\\n\\nIf Yarn is installed, but your shell (zsh in this case) cannot find it, the most likely cause is that Yarn's installation directory is not in your system's PATH. The PATH environment variable is a list of directories that the shell searches through when you enter a command. If the directory containing Yarn isn't listed, the shell won't be able to find and execute it.\\n\\n**Fixing PATH Issues:**\\n\\nTo fix this, you need to add Yarn's executable to your PATH. The method for doing this can vary based on how Yarn was installed and your operating system. Here's how you might do it for a common Yarn installation via npm:\\n\\n1. **Find where Yarn was installed**: Running `npm list -g yarn` can help you locate it.\\n2. **Add Yarn to your PATH**: You'll need to edit your `.zshrc` file (since you're using zsh as your shell). Open this file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing `/path/to/yarn` with the actual path to Yarn's directory:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport PATH=\\\"$PATH:/path/to/yarn\\\"\\n```\\n\\n3. **Apply the changes**: Run `source ~/.zshrc` or simply restart your terminal to apply the changes.\\n\\n### 3. Installation Wasn't Successful\\n\\nIf you attempted to install Yarn but the installation wasn't successful, you might still see this error. Review the installation steps to ensure they were completed without error. Checking the installation logs might provide insights into what went wrong.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\nAfter resolving the issue, running `yarn build:release` should initiate the build process for your project without showing the `command not found` error. If you encounter any other issues, ensure that your project dependencies are correctly configured to use Yarn and that there are no other environment-specific issues."

                "content": "Given the command line dialogue you've provided, it seems like you've encountered a couple of key issues in deploying your smart contract and managing your development environment. Let's address them:\\n\\n### 1. NEAR CLI Command Not Found\\n\\nThe error message `./deploy.sh: line 2: near: command not found` suggests that the NEAR CLI is not properly installed or not found in your system's PATH. Despite attempting to install NEAR CLI using npm, it appears that there was a conflict because a file named `near` already exists in your npm global bin directory. This conflict prevented the installation from completing successfully.\\n\\n### 2. Yarn Command Not Found\\n\\nSimilarly, the `zsh: command not found: yarn` error indicates that Yarn is either not installed or not included in your system's PATH. This problem persists even after you attempted to install Yarn globally through npm.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n#### Fixing NEAR CLI Installation\\n\\nFirst, let's address the NEAR CLI installation issue. You encountered an error because an existing `near` file is in your npm global bin directory, preventing the installation. You can try to force the installation using the `--force` flag with npm or manually remove the existing `near` file before installation.\\n\\nTo force reinstall NEAR CLI, you can run:\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global near-cli --force\\n```\\n\\nOr, delete the existing `near` binary and then reinstall NEAR CLI:\\n```bash\\nrm /Users/beccawilliams/.npm-global/bin/near\\nnpm install --global near-cli\\n```\\n\\nAfter installation, ensure that the npm global bin directory is in your PATH. Add it to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:\\n```bash\\nexport PATH=\\\"$PATH:/Users/beccawilliams/.npm-global/bin\\\"\\n```\\nThen, source your profile or restart the terminal:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nor for Bash:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.bash_profile\\n```\\n\\n#### Fixing Yarn Installation\\n\\nFor Yarn, you attempted to install it globally after encountering the command not found error, but it seems there was an issue recognizing the installation. Ensure that Yarn's installation path is added to your system's PATH.\\n\\nYarn provides documentation on how to configure the PATH after a global installation. Typically, adding Yarn to your PATH involves adding a line similar to the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:\\n```bash\\nexport PATH=\\\"$PATH:`yarn global bin`\\\"\\n```\\nAfter modifying your shell configuration file, apply the changes:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nor for Bash:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.bash_profile\\n```\\n\\n### General Advice\\n\\n- After making changes to the PATH or installing command-line tools, it's a good practice to open a new terminal window to ensure that all changes are applied.\\n- Ensure that the scripts (like `deploy.sh`) you're executing have the correct permissions and that any commands within them are accessible from your PATH.\\n\\nThis should resolve the issues with both the NEAR CLI and Yarn not being found. If you continue to encounter problems, double-check the installation steps and ensure there are no typos in your PATH configuration."

It indicates that 23 of the packages (dependencies) installed as part of your command have included metadata expressing that they are seeking financial contributions to support their development.\\n\\nThis information is included in the package's `package.json` file under a `funding` field, which usually contains a URL pointing to a place where you can learn more about how to fund the project's development, such as a Patreon page, Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors profile, or another crowdfunding platform.\\n\\n### Why Do Packages Seek Funding?\\n\\nOpen-source projects often rely on the community for support. Maintaining a project can require a significant amount of time and resources. Funding helps maintainers:\\n\\n- Dedicate more time to develop new features and maintain existing ones\\n- Cover costs associated with development, such as hosting or software licenses\\n- Support the project's sustainability and growth over time\\n\\n### How to Respond to the Message\\n\\nIf you or your organization heavily relies on certain open-source packages, consider following the links provided in the funding messages to see if there's a way you can contribute financially. Supporting open-source projects can help ensure their longevity and improve the tools you rely on.\\n\\n### How to See Funding Requests\\n\\nIf you want to see which packages are requesting funding after you've installed packages, you can use specific commands to list them:\\n\\nFor npm (version 6.13.0 and later), you can run:\\n```bash\\nnpm fund\\n```\\n\\nFor Yarn, as of my last update, Yarn does not have a built-in command similar to `npm fund`, but you can manually check the `package.json` files of your dependencies for funding information.\\n\\nRemember, contributing to open-source is not only about funding. Contributing code, reporting bugs, helping with documentation, and engaging with the community are also valuable ways to support open-source projects."

Here's how you can do this for either the Z shell (`zsh`) or Bash, which are common shells on macOS and Linux systems.\\n\\n### For Zsh Users\\n\\n1. **Open your terminal.**\\n\\n2. **Use a text editor to open your `~/.zshrc` file.** You can use any text editor like `nano`, `vim`, or even graphical ones. If you're comfortable with `nano`, you can type:\\n   ```bash\\n   nano ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n   \\n3. **Add the npm global bin directory to your PATH.** First, you need to find out where npm has set the global bin directory. You can do this by running:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm bin -g\\n   ```\\n   It will output a path, something like `/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin`. You need to add this path to your PATH variable by adding the following line at the end of your `~/.zshrc` file:\\n   ```bash\\n   export PATH=\\\"$PATH:/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Make sure to replace `/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin` with the actual path you got from `npm bin -g`.\\n\\n4. **Save your changes and exit the editor.** If you're using `nano`, you can press `Ctrl+O`, `Enter` to save, and then `Ctrl+X` to exit.\\n\\n5. **Apply the changes.** To make sure your current terminal session uses the updated PATH, source your `~/.zshrc` file by running:\\n   ```bash\\n   source ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n\\n### For Bash Users\\n\\nThe process is similar if you're using Bash instead of Zsh.\\n\\n1. **Open your terminal.**\\n\\n2. **Open your `~/.bash_profile` file in a text editor.** If you're on a system that uses `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`, open that file instead. Using `nano`:\\n   ```bash\\n   nano ~/.bash_profile\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Add the npm global bin directory to your PATH.** Find the path with `npm bin -g` as described above, then add the following line to `~/.bash_profile`:\\n   ```bash\\n   export PATH=\\\"$PATH:/Users/yourusername/.npm-global/bin\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Ensure you replace the path with the correct one for your setup.\\n\\n4. **Save and exit the text editor.**\\n\\n5. **Apply the changes by sourcing your profile.** For `.bash_profile`:\\n   ```bash\\n   source ~/.bash_profile\\n   ```\\n\\nAfter following these steps, your terminal will recognize commands for globally installed npm packages. You can confirm that a package is correctly found in the PATH by typing its name into the terminal and pressing Enter. If it runs, you've successfully added it to your PATH."

If you're using Zsh as your shell, this file is executed every time you open a new terminal window or tab, allowing you to customize your shell environment. Here's how you can locate and edit your `~/.zshrc` file:\\n\\n### Using Terminal to Open `~/.zshrc`\\n\\n1. **Open Terminal**: Start by opening a Terminal window.\\n\\n2. **Check if `~/.zshrc` Exists**: Before trying to open the `~/.zshrc` file, you might want to check if it exists since it's not always created by default. Run:\\n   ```bash\\n   ls -la ~ | grep .zshrc\\n   ```\\n   This command lists all files in your home directory (`~`), including hidden ones (`-a` flag), and then filters (`grep`) for `.zshrc`. If you see `.zshrc` in the output, the file exists.\\n\\n3. **Open `~/.zshrc` with a Text Editor**: You can use any text editor that you're comfortable with. Common command-line editors include `nano`, `vim`, and `emacs`. To open the file with `nano`, for example, run:\\n   ```bash\\n   nano ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n   If you prefer a graphical text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.), and it's installed on your system, you can typically open the file directly from the terminal as well. For example, with Visual Studio Code, you can run:\\n   ```bash\\n   code ~/.zshrc\\n   ```\\n\\n### Creating `~/.zshrc` if It Doesn't Exist\\n\\nIf the `~/.zshrc` file doesn't exist, you can create it simply by opening it with a text editor command. For instance, using `nano`:\\n```bash\\nnano ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nAs soon as you save changes to this new file, it will be created.\\n\\n### Applying Changes\\n\\nAfter editing and saving changes to your `~/.zshrc` file, you'll need to reload it for the changes to take effect in your current terminal session. You can do this by running:\\n```bash\\nsource ~/.zshrc\\n```\\nor, equivalently:\\n```bash\\n. ~/.zshrc\\n```\\n\\nThis command executes the `~/.zshrc` file, applying any changes you've made. If you open a new terminal window or tab, it will automatically load the updated configuration without needing to manually source it."

However, for this to work, VSCode needs to be included in your system's PATH, which is a list of directories that the shell searches through when you type a command.\\n\\n### How to Fix It\\n\\nTo fix this issue, you need to install the `code` command in the PATH. If you have already installed VSCode, you can add the `code` command to the PATH by following these steps:\\n\\n#### For macOS and Linux:\\n\\n1. **Open Visual Studio Code**.\\n\\n2. **Open the Command Palette** by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows.\\n\\n3. **Type 'Shell Command'** in the Command Palette search bar, and you should see an option that says `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.\\n\\n4. **Select that option** and it will configure your system so that you can invoke VSCode from the terminal by typing `code`.\\n\\n5. **Restart the Terminal** or source your profile configuration for the changes to take effect. You might need to close the terminal and open a new instance or you can try sourcing your shell configuration file (e.g., `source ~/.zshrc` for Zsh).\\n\\n#### For Windows:\\n\\nThe installer should automatically add VSCode to the PATH. If it's not working, you might need to manually add the path to the VSCode binary to your system's PATH environment variable.\\n\\n1. **Search for Environment Variables** in the Start menu and select \\\"Edit the system environment variables\\\".\\n\\n2. **Under System Properties**, click on \\\"Environment Variables\\\".\\n\\n3. **Find the 'Path' variable** under \\\"System variables\\\" or \\\"User variables\\\" and click \\\"Edit\\\".\\n\\n4. **Add a new entry** for the path to VSCode's `bin` folder, which typically is `C:\\\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Microsoft VS Code\\\\bin`.\\n\\n5. **Save and exit** all dialogs.\\n\\n6. **Restart your terminal** or computer to apply the changes.\\n\\nAfter completing these steps, you should be able to use the `code` command in the terminal to open files or directories with Visual Studio Code."

This file is essential for defining various attributes about a Node.js project, including its dependencies, scripts, and more. The `yarn build:release` command you're trying to run is likely a script defined within a `package.json` file of a specific project.\\n\\nTo resolve this issue, make sure you're executing the `yarn build:release` command in the correct directory where your project's `package.json` file is located. Here's what you should do:\\n\\n1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change directories to your project's root directory where the `package.json` file is located. For example, if your project is located in `/Users/beccawilliams/my_project`, you would run:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd /Users/beccawilliams/my_project\\n   ```\\n   Replace `/Users/beccawilliams/my_project` with the actual path to your project directory.\\n\\n2. **Verify `package.json` Exists**: Once in the correct directory, verify that a `package.json` file exists by listing the contents of the directory with:\\n   ```bash\\n   ls -l\\n   ```\\n   You should see `package.json` listed among the files.\\n\\n3. **Run the Command Again**: With the `package.json` file present in your current directory, try running the `yarn build:release` command again:\\n   ```bash\\n   yarn build:release\\n   ```\\n\\nThis command should now execute successfully, assuming that \\\"build:release\\\" is a script defined within your `package.json` file. Scripts in `package.json` are typically defined in the \\\"scripts\\\" section, like so:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"build:release\\\": \\\"your-build-command-here\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nMake sure the `build:release` script exists in your `package.json` file. If it doesn't, or if you're following instructions from a tutorial or documentation, ensure you've set up your project according to those guidelines, including any necessary scripts in your `package.json`."

Use `cd path/to/your/project` to navigate to the correct directory. Once there, use `ls` or `dir` (on Windows) to list the files and check for `package.json`.\\n\\n2. **Your Project is Not Initialized**: If this is a new project or if you've never run `npm init` or `yarn init`, you won't have a `package.json` file. This file is critical for managing project dependencies with NPM or Yarn and for defining project-specific tasks (like `yarn build:release`).\\n\\n### How to Initialize Your Project\\n\\nIf you're starting a new project or if your existing project doesn't have a `package.json` file, you can easily create this file by initializing your project with npm or Yarn. Here's how:\\n\\n#### Using npm\\n\\n1. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd path/to/your/project\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Run the following command:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm init\\n   ```\\n   \\n3. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions about your project (like its name, version, description). You can press Enter to accept default values or input your own. Once completed, a `package.json` file will be created in your project directory.\\n\\n#### Using Yarn\\n\\n1. Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal:\\n   ```bash\\n   cd path/to/your/project\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Run the following command:\\n   ```bash\\n   yarn init\\n   ```\\n   \\n3. Similar to `npm init`, you'll be prompted to answer questions about your project. Once you've answered them (or accepted the defaults), Yarn will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.\\n\\n### Adding a Script to package.json\\n\\nAfter initializing your project and creating a `package.json` file, you can add custom scripts to it. For example, to add a `build:release` script, you would:\\n\\n1. Open `package.json` in a text editor.\\n2. Locate (or add) the `\\\"scripts\\\"` section.\\n3. Add your `build:release` script as follows:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n     \\\"build:release\\\": \\\"your-command-here\\\"\\n   }\\n   ```\\n   Replace `\\\"your-command-here\\\"` with the actual command you wish to run when you execute `yarn build:release`.\\n\\n4. Save your changes to `package.json`.\\n\\nNow, when you run `yarn build:release` in your terminal (while in your project's root directory), Yarn will execute the command you specified in the `build:release` script."

                "content": "It seems you're trying to setup a function to create NFT drop links using the Keypom library. However, I noticed a typo in your code and some potential areas for improvement and clarification. Here's a detailed breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Typo in `initKeypom` function name**: The function you're trying to call is likely `initKeypom`. There's a typo in your import statement. It should be `initKeypom` instead of `initKeypom`. Please verify the correct function name based on the library documentation.\\n\\n2. **Incorrect import paths**: The import paths for `@near-js/utils`, `@near-js/keystores-node`, `@near-js/wallet-account`, and `@near-js/accounts` seem incorrect. Please ensure you have the correct package names. As of my last update, the standard NEAR SDK for JavaScript (`near-api-js`) provides these functionalities. Confirm the package names if `@keypom/core` is a wrapper or a specific library you're using.\\n\\nBased on standard NEAR development practices, here's how you might typically import from `near-api-js`:\\n```javascript\\nconst { connect, keyStores, WalletConnection } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\");\\nconst { parseNearAmount } = require(\\\"near-api-js/lib/utils/format\\\");\\n```\\n\\nFor your code, assuming `@keypom/core` and other import paths are correct in your specific context, here are the main changes and considerations:\\n\\n- Ensure all required modules are correctly installed and imported.\\n- Fix the typo in the function name, if any, based on the actual library documentation.\\n- Verify the correct usage of `parseNearAmount` based on the library you're using. If it's from `near-api-js`, the import adjustment as shown above is necessary.\\n\\nGiven these points, your corrected code snippet might still have issues if the library paths (`@keypom/core`, `@near-js/utils`, etc.) are incorrect or if there are errors in how functions are used from those libraries.\\n\\nPlease correct the import for `initKeypom` (if it was a typo) and ensure all library paths are correct. If `@keypom/core` and others are custom libraries or wrappers, ensure their APIs match your usage.\\n\\nHere is a slightly corrected version of your code with assumptions on library corrections:\\n```javascript\\nconst { initKeypom, createDrop, getEnv, formatLinkdropUrl } = require(\\\"@keypom/core\\\"); \\nconst { parseNearAmount } = require(\\\"near-api-js/lib/utils/format\\\"); // Adjusted for demonstration\\nconst { UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\").keyStores; // Adjusted for demonstration\\nconst { Near } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\"); // Adjusted for demonstration\\nconst { Account } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\"); // Adjusted for demonstration\\nconst path = require(\\\"path\\\");\\nconst homedir = require(\\\"os\\\").homedir();\\n\\nasync function fcDropKeypom(){\\n    // Code continues...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf `@keypom/core` and other mentioned packages are specific to your project or a specific set of libraries, please ensure their APIs are used correctly as per their documentation."

                "content": "It seems you're encountering a couple of issues here:\\n\\n1. The `crypto` package is deprecated and no longer supported. Since it's now a built-in Node module, you should switch to the built-in version of `crypto` in Node.js. You can require it in your project by simply using `require('crypto');` without installing it via npm.\\n\\n2. You're facing an issue with `near-sandbox` due to an unsupported platform error. The error message indicates that the `near-sandbox` package does not support Windows_NT x64 platform directly.\\n\\nTo address the first issue, if your project directly depends on the `crypto` package, you should remove it from your `package.json` and replace any usage of it with the built-in Node.js `crypto` module.\\n\\nFor the second issue (with `near-sandbox`), here are a couple of workarounds:\\n\\n### Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\\n\\nGiven that the error is related to the platform (Windows_NT x64), one workaround is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This allows you to run Linux directly on Windows, including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications. This would potentially bypass the platform support issue.\\n\\n1. **Enable WSL on Windows**: Follow the official Microsoft guide to install WSL on your Windows machine.\\n\\n2. **Install Node.js on WSL**: Once WSL is set up, you can install Node.js on your Linux distribution running inside WSL.\\n\\n3. **Proceed with `npm install` inside WSL**: Navigate to your project directory within WSL and run `npm install` again.\\n\\n### Using a Virtual Machine\\n\\nAnother alternative is using a virtual machine running Linux. This approach is more resource-intensive but works if you prefer not to use WSL. Tools like VirtualBox and VMware allow you to run a Linux distribution within a virtual machine on your Windows system.\\n\\n### Manual Installation\\n\\nIf `near-sandbox` specifically mentions any alternatives for Windows users in their documentation, follow those. Sometimes, manual installation steps or alternative methods are provided for unsupported platforms.\\n\\n### Docker\\n\\nIf `near-sandbox` can run within a Docker container, and you have Docker Desktop installed on Windows, this could be another potential workaround. Running it within a Docker container might abstract away the platform-specific issues.\\n\\nFor Docker, you would typically pull a Docker image and run a container based on that image. Here\u2019s a general way of how you might do it (check `near-sandbox` documentation for specific instructions):\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker pull <image-name>\\ndocker run -it <image-name>\\n```\\n\\nWithout direct support for Windows, these workarounds can help you proceed with your development. Always check the official documentation or GitHub repository of the package for any updates or workarounds regarding platform compatibility issues."

Deprecation Warning for the `crypto` Package\\n\\nThis warning indicates that the `crypto` package you are using is deprecated, as Node.js has its own built-in `crypto` module. To fix this:\\n\\n- Ensure your code or any dependencies do not explicitly require the deprecated `crypto` package. You can search your project for any `require('crypto')` statements and ensure they are not referring to the deprecated package. Node.js's built-in `crypto` can be used directly without installing anything.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\\n```\\n\\n- After ensuring the built-in `crypto` module is used, you can remove the deprecated package from your `package.json` if it's listed there and run `npm install` again.\\n\\n### 2. Errors with `near-sandbox` Installation on Windows\\n\\nThe error message indicates that `near-sandbox` does not support the Windows_NT x64 platform directly. Given the repeated occurrence of this issue, here are some alternative approaches:\\n\\n#### Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\\n\\nUsing WSL to provide a Linux environment on your Windows machine could circumvent the platform compatibility issue:\\n\\n- Install WSL by following the official Microsoft guide.\\n- With WSL installed, open a Linux terminal, navigate to your project directory, and try running `npm install` again within this environment.\\n\\n#### Check for Alternative Installation Methods\\n\\nSometimes, package maintainers provide alternative installation methods for platforms that are not directly supported. Check the `near-sandbox` documentation or GitHub repository for any such instructions.\\n\\n### 3. Handling `EBUSY` Error\\n\\nThe `EBUSY: resource busy or locked` error might be caused by a few different factors including files being locked by another process, antivirus software, or issues with the file system. To resolve this:\\n\\n- Ensure no processes are using the `node_modules` directory. This can include IDEs, terminal instances, or any background processes.\\n- Temporarily disable any antivirus software to rule out interference with file operations, then try running `npm install` again.\\n- Use the Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator to ensure you have adequate permissions when running `npm install`.\\n\\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, manually deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file (if present) before running `npm install` again can sometimes clear up any inconsistencies.\\n\\n### General Tips\\n\\n- Always ensure you're using a terminal environment that has the necessary permissions to modify files and directories within your project folder.\\n- If you're not already, considering using a package manager like `yarn` as an alternative to `npm` might provide different outcomes for the issues you're encountering.\\n\\nRemember to check for any project-specific or package-specific documentation regarding installation on Windows, as there may be known issues with workarounds or fixes available."

                "content": "Your contract looks mostly correct, with the structure and methods aligning well with the intended functionality. However, there are some details and missing imports that need to be addressed for the contract to compile and work properly on the NEAR blockchain. Let's go through them:\\n\\n1. **Missing Imports**: Your contract uses several types and functions (`AccountId`, `Promise`, `env::log`) that are not directly imported in the code snippet you provided. Let's make sure to include these by adding the necessary imports at the top:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::{env, near_bindgen, Promise};\\nuse near_sdk::serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\\nuse near_sdk::json_types::U64;\\nuse near_sdk::collections::UnorderedMap;\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\n```\\n\\n2. **AccountId Type**: The `AccountId` type is used in your `Callback` struct but not defined. Typically, the `AccountId` is a type alias for a `String` provided by the `near_sdk`. Ensure this is correctly imported or defined:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::AccountId;\\n```\\n\\n3. **Handling `AccountId` and JSON Serialization/Derialization**: When dealing with account IDs and serialization, it's often necessary to use `AccountId` (which under the hood is a validated `String`) directly. Your serialization traits are correctly applied, but ensure that all relevant fields are indeed serializable/deserializable as needed.\\n\\n4. **Error Handling for `serde_json::to_vec`**: You're correctly handling potential serialization errors by defaulting to an empty vector (`Vec<u8>`) in case of failure. This is a reasonable approach, but depending on your application's requirements, you might want to log this error or handle it differently.\\n\\n5. **GAS and Balance Values**: You've hard-coded the gas amount for the promise call. While this might work, consider defining these as constants at the beginning of your contract to improve readability and maintainability:\\n\\n```rust\\nconst CALLBACK_GAS: u64 = 300_000_000_000_000; // 300 TeraGas\\nconst ATTACHED_DEPOSIT: u128 = 0; // No attached deposit\\n```\\n\\nThen, use these constants in your `function_call`:\\n\\n```rust\\nPromise::new(callback.id)\\n    .function_call(\\n        callback.method.clone().into_bytes(),\\n        response_data,\\n        ATTACHED_DEPOSIT,\\n        CALLBACK_GAS,\\n    );\\n```\\n\\n6. **Logging**: The use of `env::log` is appropriate for logging. Just ensure that the NEAR SDK version you're using supports the methods and features you're utilizing.\\n\\nFinally, here is a minor correction in how you increment `request_id`. Your current method is fine, but ensure that the `U64` type (a wrapper around `u64` for JSON serialization) behaves as expected with `.into()` and `checked_add`.\\n\\nGiven these points, your contract structure is fundamentally sound. Make sure to test thoroughly, especially the serialization/deserialization parts and the execution flow involving promises, as these are crucial for the correct operation of your contract in real-world scenarios."

You'll need to adjust the details\u2014such as the method names, parameters, and expected outcomes\u2014based on your specific contract functions and logic.\\n\\nRemember, the purpose of these tests is to simulate various contract interactions and check for correct behavior, so you'll want to expand these examples to cover all relevant use cases in your contract. Always test edge cases, such as incorrect inputs or conditions that should fail, to ensure your contract is robust and behaves as expected in all situations."

The smart contract, however, is a separate entity that lives on the NEAR blockchain and interacts with your frontend through NEAR's API.\\n\\nTypically, in a project structure that includes a React frontend and a NEAR smart contract, you would organize your directories to separate these concerns. A common approach is to have a top-level directory for your project, with separate subdirectories for your frontend and your smart contract code. For example:\\n\\n```\\nmy-near-dapp/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 contract/\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/\\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib.rs  // Your Rust smart contract goes here\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 frontend/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 public/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json\\n```\\n\\n- The `contract/` directory contains your smart contract code, written in Rust. This is where you would use `cargo` to manage Rust dependencies, compile the smart contract, and deploy it to the NEAR blockchain.\\n- The `frontend/` directory is where your React application resides. You generated this part with `npx` and it's set up for developing the user interface of your dApp.\\n\\nThis structure helps maintain the separation of concerns between your contract code and frontend, making the project easier to manage.\\n\\n### Quick Start for Smart Contract with Rust\\n\\nTo add a smart contract to your project, you can initialize a new Rust project inside the `contract/` directory. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\n1. Navigate to your project directory:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd my-near-dapp\\n```\\n\\n2. Create the contract directory and navigate into it:\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir contract && cd contract\\n```\\n\\n3. Initialize a new Rust library project:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo init --lib\\n```\\n\\n4. Replace the contents of `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` with the appropriate configurations and Rust code for your smart contract respectively.\\n\\n5. After developing your smart contract, you'll compile and deploy it to the NEAR testnet or mainnet, depending on your needs.\\n\\nRemember, the specifics of writing the smart contract, such as the contract's functions and how it manages state, will depend on the requirements of your dApp."

When developing on the NEAR blockchain, it's essential to understand the distinction between a NEAR webapp (frontend) and a NEAR contract (smart contract), as well as how they work together to create a full-stack decentralized application (dApp).\\n\\n### NEAR Contract (Smart Contract)\\n\\n- **Definition**: A NEAR contract is essentially a smart contract deployed on the NEAR blockchain. It contains the business logic and state management of your dApp. Smart contracts on NEAR are usually written in Rust (for performance and safety) or AssemblyScript (for JavaScript-like syntax). These contracts are executed on the blockchain in a secure and decentralized manner.\\n  \\n- **Functionality**: Smart contracts handle tasks such as processing transactions, managing blockchain state (e.g., account balances, NFT ownership records), and executing the core logic of your dApp (e.g., voting mechanisms, financial calculations).\\n\\n- **Development & Deployment**: You develop NEAR contracts using tools like `near-cli` for deployment and interaction. The smart contract code is compiled into WebAssembly (WASM) before being deployed to the NEAR blockchain.\\n\\n### NEAR Webapp (Frontend)\\n\\n- **Definition**: A NEAR webapp refers to the frontend part of your dApp, which users interact with. It's typically a web application developed using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. This webapp communicates with the NEAR blockchain, often through a library like `near-api-js`, to send transactions, query blockchain state, and interact with smart contracts.\\n\\n- **Functionality**: The webapp provides a user interface (UI) for your dApp, allowing users to perform actions like sending tokens, minting NFTs, or participating in decentralized governance, depending on what your dApp offers. It handles user inputs, displays blockchain data, and calls smart contract functions.\\n\\n### Using Both for a Full-Stack dApp\\n\\nTo create a full-stack dApp on NEAR, you combine a NEAR contract (smart contract) with a NEAR webapp (frontend):\\n\\n1. **Develop the Smart Contract**: Start by writing the smart contract in Rust or AssemblyScript. This contract includes the core logic and state management of your dApp. You'll test and deploy this contract to the NEAR blockchain.\\n\\n2. **Build the Frontend**: Develop the webapp using a JavaScript framework of your choice. This webapp will use `near-api-js` or a similar library to interact with the NEAR blockchain and your smart contract. It handles user interactions, calls to the smart contract, and displays data from the blockchain.\\n\\n3. **Integrate the Two**: Ensure the webapp correctly interacts with the smart contract by calling its functions and handling the responses. This includes reading from the blockchain and sending transactions to it.\\n\\n4. **Deployment**: Deploy your webapp to a suitable hosting service, and ensure your smart contract is deployed on the NEAR blockchain (testnet or mainnet).\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nA common example could be a decentralized marketplace dApp:\\n\\n- **Smart Contract**: Manages listings, transactions, and ownership records on the blockchain.\\n- **Webapp**: Provides a UI for users to browse listings, post new items for sale, and buy items.\\n\\nBy combining these components, you can create sophisticated, decentralized applications that leverage the strengths of the NEAR blockchain for security, scalability, and user ownership.\\n\\nWould you like more detailed guidance on either creating the smart contract or developing the frontend?"

                "content": "Given that you've already set up the frontend of your dApp with `npx create-near-app`, the next step is to add the smart contract component to complete your full-stack dApp. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\n### Step 1: Preparing for Smart Contract Development\\n\\n1. **Ensure Rust is Installed**: Smart contracts for NEAR are often written in Rust due to its performance and safety features. If you haven't already, install Rust and the `cargo` package manager. You can do this by running the following command:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\\n    ```\\n\\n    Follow the prompts to complete the installation.\\n\\n2. **Install NEAR CLI**: The NEAR Command Line Interface (CLI) is a useful tool for interacting with the NEAR blockchain, including deploying smart contracts. Install it globally via npm:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm install -g near-cli\\n    ```\\n\\n### Step 2: Adding a Smart Contract to Your Project\\n\\n1. **Create a Contract Directory**: In your project's root directory, create a new directory for your smart contract.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    mkdir contract && cd contract\\n    ```\\n\\n2. **Initialize a Rust Library**: Smart contracts in NEAR are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), and Rust libraries facilitate this. Initialize a new Rust library in the `contract` directory.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    cargo init --lib\\n    ```\\n\\n3. **Write Your Smart Contract**: Replace the contents of `src/lib.rs` with your smart contract code. Here's a basic example of a smart contract that allows storing and retrieving a message:\\n\\n    ```rust\\n    // src/lib.rs\\n    use near_sdk::near_bindgen;\\n\\n    #[near_bindgen]\\n    #[derive(Default)]\\n    pub struct Welcome {\\n        message: String,\\n    }\\n\\n    #[near_bindgen]\\n    impl Welcome {\\n        pub fn set_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n            self.message = message;\\n        }\\n\\n        pub fn get_message(&self) -> String {\\n            self.message.clone()\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    #[cfg(test)]\\n    mod tests {\\n        use super::*;\\n\\n        #[test]\\n        fn set_then_get_message() {\\n            let mut contract = Welcome { message: \\\"Hello\\\".to_string() };\\n            contract.set_message(\\\"Hello, NEAR!\\\".to_string());\\n            assert_eq!(\\\"Hello, NEAR!\\\", contract.get_message());\\n        }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n4. **Add `near-sdk` Dependency**: Edit your `Cargo.toml` to include the `near-sdk` dependency, which provides the necessary tools and macros for smart contract development.\\n\\n    ```toml\\n    [dependencies]\\n    near-sdk = \\\"4.0.0-pre.4\\\"\\n    ```\\n\\n### Step 3: Building and Deploying Your Smart Contract\\n\\n1. **Build the Smart Contract**: Inside the `contract` directory, use the following command to compile your smart contract to WebAssembly (WASM). This step requires the Rust toolchain.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n    ```\\n\\n2. **Deploy the Smart Contract**: Use the `near-cli` to deploy your compiled smart contract to the NEAR testnet or mainnet. First, ensure you're logged in to a NEAR account:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near login\\n    ```\\n\\n    Then, deploy your smart contract. Replace `<your-account>` with your NEAR account name.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_contract_name.wasm --accountId <your-account>\\n    ```\\n\\n### Step 4: Integrating the Smart Contract with Your Frontend\\n\\n- **Use `near-api-js`**: In your frontend code, utilize `near-api-js` for interacting with your smart contract. This involves calling contract methods and handling responses. Make sure you've installed `near-api-js` in your frontend project:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm install near-api-js\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Update Frontend Code**: Adapt your frontend code to call the smart contract's functions. For example, to call the `set_message` and `get_message` functions, you'd use code similar to the following:\\n\\n    ```javascript\\n    // Example of calling a smart contract function from the frontend\\n    async function setMessage(message) {\\n        const contract = await window.near.contract; // Assume contract is initialized\\n        await contract.set_message({ message });\\n    }\\n\\n    async function getMessage() {\\n        const contract = await window.near.contract; // Assume contract is initialized\\n        return await contract.get_message({});\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\nThis guide outlines the basic steps to add a smart contract to your project and integrate it with your frontend, turning your project into a full-stack dApp. The specifics can vary based on your dApp's requirements and the complexity of your smart contract."

                "content": "The errors you're encountering are due to a few different issues, but they can be resolved. Let's tackle them systematically:\\n\\n### The `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Target Not Installed\\n\\nThis error occurs because the Rust toolchain does not have the WebAssembly (WASM) compilation target installed. This target is necessary for compiling Rust code into WebAssembly, which is the format required for smart contracts on the NEAR platform.\\n\\n**Solution**: Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target by running:\\n\\n```bash\\nrustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\\n```\\n\\n### `cargo build` Errors Regarding `core` and Macros\\n\\nWhen you encounter errors related to not finding the `core` crate or macros like `assert_eq`, it often means there's an issue with the compilation target or the project's setup for building a WASM binary. The earlier step of adding the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target should resolve most of these.\\n\\n### Linker `cc` Not Found\\n\\nThis error indicates that the C compiler is not found on your system, which is required for certain dependencies or build scripts that involve native code compilation.\\n\\n**Solution**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed. On Ubuntu or other Debian-based systems, you can install `build-essential`:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential\\n```\\n\\nOn macOS, ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed:\\n\\n```bash\\nxcode-select --install\\n```\\n\\nOn Windows, you can use the Build Tools for Visual Studio.\\n\\n### Contract-Specific Suggestions\\n\\nYour smart contract code looks generally well-structured for a NEAR smart contract. Once you resolve the above environment and toolchain issues, you should be able to compile your contract. However, pay attention to these additional points:\\n\\n- **Storage Key Uniqueness**: When using `UnorderedMap::new`, ensure that the prefix passed to `new` (in your case, `b\\\"l\\\"`) is unique across different instances of `UnorderedMap` or any other NEAR SDK collections like `Vector` or `LookupMap` within the same contract. This is crucial for preventing data collision.\\n\\n- **Testing**: After resolving the compilation issues, don't forget to write and run tests. Testing is essential for ensuring that your contract logic works as expected. The NEAR SDK provides a way to simulate blockchain environment for testing purposes.\\n\\n- **Deployment**: Once successfully compiled, remember to deploy your contract using `near-cli` and test it in a live environment, starting with testnet.\\n\\nAfter making these adjustments and ensuring your environment is correctly set up, try compiling your contract again. If you encounter more specific errors, feel free to ask for further assistance!"

                "content": "To build, compile, and deploy your Rust smart contract to the NEAR blockchain, follow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Set Up Your NEAR Account\\n\\nBefore you deploy, you need a NEAR account to associate with the smart contract. If you haven't already, create a NEAR account on the [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org) for the testnet environment or on the [mainnet wallet](https://wallet.near.org) for production. The rest of this guide assumes you're using the testnet.\\n\\n### Step 2: Build and Compile Your Smart Contract\\n\\n1. **Ensure Rust is Installed**: If you haven't already, install Rust.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\\n    ```\\n\\n    Follow the on-screen instructions.\\n\\n2. **Add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Target**:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\\n    ```\\n\\n3. **Build the Contract**: Navigate to your contract directory and compile the contract with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    cd path/to/your/contract\\n    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n    ```\\n\\n    After the build completes, you'll find the compiled WebAssembly file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` directory. The file name will be your project name with a `.wasm` extension (e.g., `art_marketplace.wasm`).\\n\\n### Step 3: Install NEAR CLI\\n\\nThe NEAR CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. If you haven't installed it yet:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g near-cli\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Log in With NEAR CLI\\n\\nBefore deploying, make sure you're logged in with your NEAR account via the NEAR CLI:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nThis command opens a web page asking you to authorize the NEAR CLI on your account. Follow the instructions.\\n\\n### Step 5: Deploy the Smart Contract\\n\\nWith the NEAR account set up and the smart contract compiled, deploy it using the NEAR CLI. Replace `<your-account>` with your NEAR account name and `<your-contract.wasm>` with the path to your compiled WebAssembly file.\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId <your-account>.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_contract_name.wasm\\n```\\n\\n### Step 6: Verify Deployment\\n\\nAfter deployment, you can call the contract's methods to verify it's working as expected. For example, if your contract has a method named `get_message`, you could call it like this:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear call <your-account>.testnet get_message '{}' --accountId <your-account>.testnet\\n```\\n\\nRemember to replace `<your-account>` with your actual account name and `get_message` with a method from your contract.\\n\\n### Note on Deployment to Mainnet\\n\\nIf you are deploying to the mainnet, replace `.testnet` with `.near` in your account name and ensure you have a mainnet account. It's highly recommended only to deploy to the mainnet when your contract is fully tested and reviewed for security.\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis guide covers the basic steps to build, compile, and deploy a smart contract to the NEAR blockchain. Each contract and application might require additional steps or considerations, especially concerning security, testing, and front-end integration."

These can also lock the `target` directory.\\n\\n3. **Orphaned Lock File**: Occasionally, the lock file may not be properly cleaned up after a build process completes, especially if the process was interrupted. \\n\\n### Resolutions\\n\\nHere are steps to resolve this issue:\\n\\n#### Wait for the Current Process to Complete\\n\\nIf there's a legitimate reason for the lock (e.g., another build command you ran is still processing), the simplest solution is to wait for it to complete.\\n\\n#### Close Other Instances\\n\\nEnsure you don't have any other terminals, Rust tools, or IDEs that might be running `cargo build` concurrently. Close any that are unnecessary.\\n\\n#### Check for Orphaned Cargo Processes\\n\\nSometimes, a cargo process might hang in the background. You can check and kill any orphaned processes:\\n\\n- **On Linux/macOS**:\\n    1. Find cargo processes: `ps aux | grep cargo`\\n    2. Kill any that seem stuck, using: `kill -9 <PID>` (replace `<PID>` with the process ID)\\n\\n- **On Windows**:\\n    1. Open Task Manager.\\n    2. Look for any `cargo.exe` processes in the \\\"Details\\\" tab.\\n    3. Right-click and select \\\"End task\\\" for any that seem stuck.\\n\\n#### Remove the Lock File\\n\\nIf you're confident no cargo processes should be running, you can manually remove the lock file. This file is typically located in the `target` directory:\\n\\n- Navigate to your project's `target` directory.\\n- Look for a directory named `.cargo-lock` or files with a `.lock` extension.\\n- Delete these lock files or directories.\\n\\n**Example on Linux/macOS**:\\n\\n```bash\\nrm -rf /path/to/your/project/target/.cargo-lock\\n```\\n\\n**On Windows**, navigate to the folder in File Explorer and delete the `.cargo-lock` directory.\\n\\nAfter clearing the lock, try running your `cargo build` command again.\\n\\n#### Restart Your Computer\\n\\nAs a last resort, restarting your computer can clear any stuck processes and locks, resolving the issue.\\n\\n### Caution\\n\\nBe cautious when manually deleting files or killing processes. Ensure you're not interrupting a valid build process or removing files essential to your project."

Here's how you can address common cargo lock issues:\\n\\n### 1. Update Dependencies\\n\\nCargo lock issues can sometimes be resolved by updating your dependencies. This can help resolve conflicts between versions that your project and its dependencies require.\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo update\\n```\\n\\nThis command updates your `Cargo.lock` file with the latest compatible versions of your dependencies as per the specifications in `Cargo.toml`.\\n\\n### 2. Delete Cargo.lock and Regenerate\\n\\nIf the issue is due to a corrupted `Cargo.lock` file or outdated dependencies that can't be resolved with `cargo update`, you might want to try regenerating the `Cargo.lock` file.\\n\\nFirst, delete the `Cargo.lock` file:\\n\\n```bash\\nrm Cargo.lock\\n```\\n\\nThen, build your project again. Cargo will regenerate a new `Cargo.lock` file with the latest compatible versions.\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo build\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Clear Cargo's Registry Cache\\n\\nSometimes, the issue might be with Cargo's registry index. Clearing Cargo's cache can force it to fetch a fresh copy of the registry, which might solve the problem.\\n\\nTo clear Cargo's cache, delete the registry cache by removing the `registry` directory located in Cargo's cache directory. The location of this directory varies by operating system:\\n\\n- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.cargo/registry`\\n- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\\\\.cargo\\\\registry`\\n\\nYou can use the following commands to remove the registry cache:\\n\\n**Linux/macOS**:\\n\\n```bash\\nrm -rf ~/.cargo/registry\\n```\\n\\n**Windows** (in Command Prompt):\\n\\n```cmd\\nrmdir /s /q %USERPROFILE%\\\\.cargo\\\\registry\\n```\\n\\nAfter clearing the cache, run `cargo build` to rebuild your project. Cargo will fetch the necessary dependencies again.\\n\\n### 4. Check for Conflicting Dependencies\\n\\nIf the issue persists, there might be conflicting versions required by different dependencies. Examine your `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files closely to identify any conflicts. Look for dependencies that require different versions of the same crate.\\n\\nYou can try specifying compatible version numbers in `Cargo.toml` or using the `cargo tree` command to inspect the dependency tree:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo tree\\n```\\n\\nThis command helps you visualize dependency versions and identify where conflicts might be occurring.\\n\\n### 5. Seek Help with Specific Errors\\n\\nIf the problem relates to specific error messages regarding cargo lock issues, consider searching for those errors directly. The Rust user forum, the Rust subreddit, and the issue trackers for the relevant crates can be excellent resources for solutions to specific problems.\\n\\nIf you're still facing issues, feel free to provide more detailed information about the errors you're encountering, and I'll do my best to offer more targeted assistance."

This error can occur for a few reasons, especially when working within a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment, as indicated by your command prompt (`/mnt/c/Users/...`).\\n\\nHere are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\\n\\n### 1. Permissions Issues\\n\\nThe error could be due to insufficient permissions to create or modify the `.cargo-lock` file in the `target/release` directory. Ensure you have the proper permissions:\\n\\n- **Check Permissions**: Navigate to your project directory and check the permissions of the `target` directory and its subdirectories. You can use `ls -l` to list permissions.\\n\\n- **Modify Permissions**: If permissions are restrictive, you can modify them using the `chmod` command. For example, to add write permissions, you could use:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  chmod -R +w /mnt/c/Users/seanw/Code/Graffito/pbc24/near/contract/target/\\n  ```\\n\\n  This command adds write permissions recursively to the `target` directory and all its contents. Be cautious with permission changes, and ensure you're only modifying your own project files.\\n\\n### 2. File System Locks\\n\\nSometimes, file system locks or synchronization issues between Windows and WSL can cause access problems. Make sure no other processes (e.g., editors, IDEs, other terminal windows) are accessing these files. Closing and reopening your terminal or editor, or even restarting WSL, can sometimes resolve these locks.\\n\\n### 3. Running Cargo as Root\\n\\nIf you've been running `cargo` as root (using `sudo`), it might have created files that your normal user account cannot modify. Avoid running `cargo build` as root. If you already did, you might need to change the ownership of the `target` directory back to your user:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mnt/c/Users/seanw/Code/Graffito/pbc24/near/contract/target/\\n```\\n\\n### 4. WSL and Windows File System Interactions\\n\\nThere are known issues with file system performance and file locking when accessing Windows files from within WSL. If possible, try moving your project to the Linux file system side of WSL (e.g., somewhere under `/home/yourusername/`) rather than accessing it directly from the Windows side (`/mnt/c/...`). This can not only avoid certain cross-file system issues but also significantly improve build times and overall performance.\\n\\n```bash\\nmv /mnt/c/Users/seanw/Code/Graffito/pbc24/near/contract ~/projects/near/contract\\n```\\n\\nAfter moving, navigate to the new location in WSL and try building again.\\n\\n### 5. Clean and Rebuild\\n\\nSometimes, cleaning the project can resolve strange build issues. Use `cargo clean` to remove the `target` directory, then attempt to build again:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo clean\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThese steps address common causes for the error you're seeing. If the problem persists after trying these solutions, consider providing additional context, such as any changes to your environment or setup, for further assistance."

These alternatives might help work around specific environment issues or preferences for tooling and workflows.\\n\\n### Option 1: Use a Docker Container\\n\\nUsing Docker to create a consistent development environment can help bypass local setup issues. Docker can encapsulate all the necessary tools and dependencies, providing a clean, controlled setting for building and deploying your smart contract.\\n\\n1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root with the necessary setup. Here's an example Dockerfile for a Rust and NEAR development environment:\\n\\n    ```Dockerfile\\n    FROM rust:latest\\n\\n    # Install wasm target\\n    RUN rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\\n\\n    # Install NEAR CLI\\n    RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | bash -\\n    RUN apt-get install -y nodejs\\n    RUN npm install -g near-cli\\n\\n    WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp\\n\\n    COPY . .\\n\\n    CMD [\\\"/bin/bash\\\"]\\n    ```\\n\\n    This Dockerfile does the following:\\n    - Starts from the latest Rust image.\\n    - Adds the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\\n    - Installs Node.js and the NEAR CLI.\\n    - Sets the working directory and copies your project into the Docker container.\\n\\n2. **Build and Run Your Docker Container**:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    docker build -t near-project .\\n    docker run -it near-project\\n    ```\\n\\n    Replace `near-project` with a name for your project.\\n\\n3. **Inside the Container**:\\n    - Once inside the container, you can run `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` and deploy using NEAR CLI commands as you would normally do.\\n\\n### Option 2: Use a Virtual Machine\\n\\nIf Docker is not preferable, another approach is to use a Virtual Machine (VM) with a fresh Linux installation. Tools like VirtualBox or VMware allow you to set up a VM, and you can choose a Linux distribution of your preference.\\n\\n1. **Install VirtualBox or VMware** on your Windows machine.\\n2. **Download a Linux Distribution**: Ubuntu is a popular choice for its ease of use.\\n3. **Create a New VM** and install Linux by following the installation instructions.\\n4. **Set Up Your Development Environment** within the VM as per the instructions provided in previous responses (install Rust, wasm target, NEAR CLI).\\n\\n### Option 3: GitHub Actions for CI/CD\\n\\nFor deployment, you can automate your build and deployment process using GitHub Actions.\\n\\n1. **Create a GitHub Repository** for your project if you haven't already.\\n2. **Add Your NEAR Account Credentials** securely as secrets in the GitHub repository settings.\\n3. **Set Up a GitHub Action Workflow**: Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow file in your repository. This file can define steps to install dependencies, build your smart contract, and deploy it to NEAR using NEAR CLI commands.\\n\\n    Note: Make sure to use GitHub secrets to store sensitive information like NEAR account access keys.\\n\\nEach of these options approaches the problem of building and deploying your contract differently, aiming to bypass specific local setup issues you might be facing. Depending on your situation, preferences, and the complexity of your project, one of these alternatives could provide a smoother development and deployment experience."

Let's troubleshoot this step-by-step to ensure you can locate or successfully generate the `.wasm` file for your `art_marketplace` smart contract.\\n\\n### 1. Verify the Build Command and Output\\n\\nFirst, ensure you're using the correct command to build your project for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. Navigate to the root of your Rust project (where your `Cargo.toml` file is located) and run:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\nWatch the output in your terminal. It should indicate the path to the generated `.wasm` file upon successful completion. If the build process fails, the output will provide error messages that can help diagnose the issue.\\n\\n### 2. Check the Expected Output Directory\\n\\nFor projects targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with Cargo, the output `.wasm` file should be located in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` directory relative to your project root. If you're not finding your `.wasm` file, navigate to this directory and look for it:\\n\\n```bash\\nls target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/\\n```\\n\\nThe `.wasm` file should be named after your project as defined in your `Cargo.toml`, not necessarily `art_marketplace.wasm`, unless specifically configured that way. For example, if your project is named `art_marketplace` in `Cargo.toml`, the file should indeed be named `art_marketplace.wasm`.\\n\\n### 3. Cargo Clean and Rebuild\\n\\nIf you're still unable to find the `.wasm` file, there might have been a problem during the build process. Try cleaning your project and rebuilding:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo clean\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Review Cargo.toml and Project Structure\\n\\nEnsure that your `Cargo.toml` is correctly configured for building a NEAR smart contract. It should include dependencies like `near-sdk` and any other necessary configurations specific to your project needs.\\n\\n### 5. Environment and Toolchain Issues\\n\\nIf the issue persists, it's possible there could be an issue with your Rust toolchain setup, especially if you're using WSL, Docker, or another virtualized environment. Ensure your Rust environment is correctly set up, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is added:\\n\\n```bash\\nrustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Manual Search for .wasm Files\\n\\nAs a last resort, you can manually search for any `.wasm` files within your project directory. From the root of your project, you can run:\\n\\n```bash\\nfind . -name \\\"*.wasm\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis command will search through your project directory and list any `.wasm` files it finds.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIf you've tried these steps and still can't find or generate the `.wasm` file, there may be a more specific issue at hand. In such cases, double-check any error messages during the build process, and consider if there's more detailed logging or verbosity options you can enable with Cargo to get more insight."

However, to ensure the Rust compiler outputs a `.wasm` file that's optimized for smart contracts, you might consider adding a few more configurations to your `Cargo.toml`. Additionally, I'll guide you through verifying your build command and directory structure to ensure you can locate your `.wasm` file.\\n\\n### Step 1: Enhance Cargo.toml\\n\\nTo optimize your smart contract for size and compatibility with the NEAR platform, you might want to add `[lib]` and `[profile.release]` sections to your `Cargo.toml`. This setup helps in reducing the size of the `.wasm` file and ensuring it is properly optimized for the blockchain environment.\\n\\n```toml\\n[package]\\nname = \\\"contract\\\"\\nversion = \\\"0.1.0\\\"\\nedition = \\\"2021\\\"\\n\\n[dependencies]\\nnear-sdk = \\\"4.0.0-pre.4\\\"\\n\\n[lib]\\ncrate-type = [\\\"cdylib\\\"]\\n\\n[profile.release]\\nopt-level = \\\"z\\\"\\nlto = true\\ndebug = false\\npanic = 'abort'\\n```\\n\\n- The `[lib]` section with `crate-type = [\\\"cdylib\\\"]` tells Rust to compile the library to a shared object which can be used as a compiled smart contract.\\n- The `[profile.release]` section optimizes for size (`opt-level = \\\"z\\\"`) and enables link-time optimizations (`lto = true`). Setting `debug = false` turns off debug information to reduce size further, and `panic = 'abort'` configures the contract to abort execution upon panics, which is a common pattern for smart contracts.\\n\\n### Step 2: Build the Contract\\n\\nAfter updating your `Cargo.toml`, navigate to your project's root directory (where the `Cargo.toml` file resides) in your terminal and run the build command:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Locating the .wasm File\\n\\nUpon a successful build, the `.wasm` file should be located in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`. Since your package is named \\\"contract,\\\" the output `.wasm` file should be named `contract.wasm`. Confirm its presence by running:\\n\\n```bash\\nls target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/\\n```\\n\\nYou should see `contract.wasm` listed among the output files.\\n\\n### Step 4: Troubleshooting\\n\\nIf you do not see the `.wasm` file:\\n\\n- Ensure the build command completed without errors. If there were errors, they need to be resolved before a `.wasm` file can be generated.\\n- Double-check you are in the correct directory when running the build command and looking for the `.wasm` file. You should be in the project root directory.\\n\\n### Step 5: Deploying the Contract\\n\\nOnce you have located `contract.wasm`, you can deploy it using the NEAR CLI. First, ensure you're logged in with `near-cli`:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nThen deploy your contract with:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId <your-account>.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm\\n```\\n\\nMake sure to replace `<your-account>.testnet` with your actual NEAR testnet account.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should successfully build, locate, and deploy your NEAR smart contract.

This is critical as it determines under which account's namespace the contract will live and who has control over it.\\n\\nTo deploy a contract, you should replace `--accountId` with the actual account ID of the account you want to deploy the contract to. Here are the steps to determine or create an appropriate account ID for this purpose:\\n\\n### If You Already Have a NEAR Account\\n- If you already have a NEAR account you wish to use, simply replace `<your-account>` with your account's name. For example, if your account name is `johndoe.testnet`, the command would look like this:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near deploy --accountId johndoe.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm\\n    ```\\n\\n### If You Need to Create a NEAR Account\\n- **On Testnet**: You can create a new account on the [NEAR Testnet Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org). Follow the instructions provided on the website. After creating an account, the account ID will be what you chose during the creation process, followed by `.testnet`. Use this account ID with the `--accountId` flag.\\n\\n- **On Mainnet**: For deploying to the main network, you would use the [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org) to create an account. Note that deploying contracts to the mainnet might involve transaction fees (in NEAR tokens), so ensure your account has a balance. Mainnet account IDs do not necessarily end with `.near` or `.testnet`; they can be top-level accounts (e.g., `johndoe.near`) or subaccounts.\\n\\n### Example Command\\nAfter determining your account ID, your deployment command should look like this (assuming your account ID is `johndoe.testnet` and you are deploying to the testnet):\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId johndoe.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm\\n```\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- Ensure you are logged into the correct account with `near-cli` before deploying. You can log in using `near login`. This command opens a web page where you can authorize the CLI tool to access your NEAR account.\\n- Keep your account secure. The account you use to deploy the contract has control over the contract, including updating its code or state.\\n\\nUsing the `--accountId` parameter correctly ensures that your smart contract is deployed under the right namespace and that you retain control over it."

You can log in with:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nThis command will open a browser window asking you to authorize access to your NEAR account. Make sure to select or log in to `pbc2024.testnet`.\\n\\n### 3. **Insufficient Funds**\\nDeploying a contract and storing data on the blockchain requires a balance to pay for transaction fees and storage. Ensure that `pbc2024.testnet` has a sufficient balance. You can check your account's balance through the NEAR Wallet or NEAR Explorer.\\n\\n### 4. **Incorrect Path to wasm File**\\nThe `--wasmFile` argument expects a valid path to the `.wasm` file generated by your build. Ensure that the path `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm` is correct and that the `.wasm` file exists in that directory. If you've moved your terminal to a different directory or if your project structure is different, the path may need to be adjusted.\\n\\n### 5. **Network Issues**\\nThere might be network issues preventing `near-cli` from communicating with the NEAR testnet. Ensure your internet connection is stable and that there are no firewalls or network policies blocking the connection.\\n\\n### 6. **Outdated `near-cli`**\\nEnsure your `near-cli` tool is up to date. You can update it using npm:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g near-cli\\n```\\n\\nAfter checking these potential issues, if you're still facing problems, consider any error messages that are output by the command.

This scenario could imply a parsing issue, possibly related to how the command is being executed in your environment, or it could be due to a change or update in `near-cli`.\\n\\nTo address this issue, let's try a slightly modified version of your command, explicitly specifying the options:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId pbc2024.testnet --wasmFile ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm\\n```\\n\\nHere, I've made sure the path to `--wasmFile` is very explicit and relative to the current directory (`./`). Although it's essentially the same, being explicit sometimes helps, especially in environments like WSL or when there are parsing issues.\\n\\n### Additional Troubleshooting Steps:\\n\\n1. **Update `near-cli`**: Ensure your `near-cli` is up to date. Outdated versions might have different requirements or bugs that have been fixed in later releases.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm install -g near-cli\\n    ```\\n\\n2. **Check `near-cli` Version**: After updating, verify the version of your `near-cli` to ensure the update was successful.\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near --version\\n    ```\\n\\n3. **Verify Installation**: Ensure that `near-cli` was installed correctly and is accessible from your terminal. Sometimes, npm global packages might not be in your PATH depending on your npm and node configuration.\\n\\n4. **Environment Check**: If you're running commands within WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), Docker, or any virtualized or containerized environment, ensure that the environment has access to the necessary network resources and that file paths are correctly resolved between different filesystems.\\n\\n5. **Consult Documentation**: If `near-cli` has been updated recently, there might have been changes to the command syntax. Check the [official documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli) or use `near --help` to see if there are updates or changes to the deployment command that you might not be aware of.\\n\\nIf you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, consider sharing more details about your development environment, such as the operating system, the shell you're using, and the version of `near-cli`. This information could provide further insights into the issue."

It seems like there might be a deeper problem with your `near-cli` setup, the environment, or potentially a misunderstanding with how the command is structured due to versions or regional settings. Let's try a different approach and break down the problem into smaller steps to diagnose and potentially bypass the issue with the deployment command.\\n\\n### Step 1: Validate `near-cli` Installation and Environment\\n\\n1. **Re-confirm `near-cli` Version**: Run `near --version` to ensure the CLI tool is correctly installed and accessible. Note the version down for reference.\\n\\n2. **Check `near-cli` Configuration**:\\n   - Run `near env` to see the current environment settings.\\n   - Ensure the network ID matches your intention (`testnet` or `mainnet`).\\n\\n### Step 2: Simplify the Deployment Command\\n\\nLet's simplify the command to see if we can get a more detailed error message or potentially resolve the parsing issue.\\n\\n1. **Navigate to Your Contract Directory**: Ensure you're in the root directory of your contract project.\\n   \\n2. **List the wasm File**: Run `ls target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` to make sure your `.wasm` file exists and note its exact name.\\n\\n3. **Try a Minimal Deployment Command**: Use this command, replacing `your-wasm-file.wasm` with the actual name of your `.wasm` file:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near deploy --accountId pbc2024.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your-wasm-file.wasm\\n    ```\\n\\n### Step 3: Use Absolute Path for the wasm File\\n\\nSometimes, using an absolute path can help if there's an issue with path resolution:\\n\\n1. **Find the Absolute Path**: Run `pwd` to print the working directory.\\n2. **Construct the Absolute Path**: Combine the output of `pwd` with the relative path to your `.wasm` file. For example, if `pwd` returns `/home/user/near-contract`, then your `--wasmFile` parameter should be `/home/user/near-contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your-wasm-file.wasm`.\\n\\n### Step 4: Testing with a Different Terminal or Command Line Interface\\n\\n1. **Try a Different Terminal**: If you're using a specific terminal emulator or shell (e.g., PowerShell, Bash in WSL, Git Bash), try switching to another one available on your system.\\n2. **Run as Administrator or With Sudo**: There might be permission issues blocking the deployment. Try running your terminal as an administrator (Windows) or prefixing your command with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) to rule this out.\\n\\n### Step 5: Manual Verification and Debug Logging\\n\\n1. **Manually Verify Account**: Make sure the account `pbc2024.testnet` exists by checking it on the [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.near.org).\\n2. **Enable Verbose Logging**: Append `-v` to your deployment command to enable verbose logging, which might provide more clues:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    near -v deploy --accountId pbc2024.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your-wasm-file.wasm\\n    ```\\n\\n### Step 6: Seeking Further Assistance\\n\\nIf after these steps the issue remains unresolved, I recommend seeking direct assistance:\\n\\n1. **NEAR Community Channels**: The NEAR [Discord server](https://near.chat) or [NEAR Forum](https://gov.near.org) are excellent places to ask for help. Be prepared to share the exact command you're running, the error message, `near-cli` version, and details about your environment.\\n2. **GitHub Issues**: If you suspect a bug with `near-cli`, consider opening an issue on the [near-cli GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/near-cli/issues) with all relevant details.\\n\\nTroubleshooting complex issues can be challenging, especially without direct access to the system or more detailed error logs. The NEAR community is very supportive, and reaching out to them with detailed information might provide you with the quickest path to a solution."

In the context of many CLI (Command Line Interface) tools, \\\"non-option arguments\\\" refer to the main arguments the command operates on, as opposed to \\\"options\\\" or \\\"flags\\\" that modify behavior.\\n\\nFor the `near-cli` scenario, specifically with the `near deploy` command you're attempting, this error suggests that the CLI was expecting additional arguments that it did not receive. However, based on the command you provided:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId pbc2024.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm\\n```\\n\\nIt appears you are using the correct syntax as per the `near-cli` documentation, where:\\n\\n- `--accountId` specifies the account deploying the contract.\\n- `--wasmFile` points to the WebAssembly file to deploy.\\n\\nThis syntax should not typically produce the \\\"Not enough non-option arguments\\\" error, given that both of these are valid options for the `near deploy` command, and the command as you've written it doesn't require additional non-option arguments.\\n\\n### Potential Causes and Solutions:\\n\\n1. **CLI Version Mismatch**: The command syntax or expectations might have changed in different versions of `near-cli`. Ensure you're using a version that matches the documentation or guides you're following.\\n\\n   - Update `near-cli` to the latest version with:\\n     ```bash\\n     npm install -g near-cli\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Quoting Issue**: Depending on the shell or terminal you're using, sometimes arguments, especially those with special characters or spaces, might need to be quoted differently. Try adjusting the quoting of your arguments, though this doesn't seem directly applicable to your command as shown.\\n\\n3. **Documentation/Help Command**: Use the `--help` option with `near deploy` or consult the official documentation to confirm the expected syntax for your version of `near-cli`. Syntax could vary slightly between versions, and the help command often provides the most up-to-date usage information:\\n   ```bash\\n   near deploy --help\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Shell or Environment Issues**: Sometimes, the way a shell or command line environment parses command options can cause unexpected behavior. You might try running the command in a different shell or on a different machine or environment to rule out local configuration issues.\\n\\nGiven the correct syntax you've shared, the error message might indeed be confusing. If updating `near-cli` and verifying the command syntax against the help documentation does not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to NEAR developer support channels or forums for more specific guidance. It's also helpful to include the version of `near-cli` you're using and the exact command and output when seeking help, as this can expedite troubleshooting."

                "content": "In the context of command-line interfaces (CLI), arguments given to commands can generally be classified into two categories: **option arguments** and **non-option arguments**.\\n\\n1. **Option Arguments (Options or Flags)**: These are arguments used to modify the behavior of a command. They typically start with a hyphen (`-`) for short options (e.g., `-v` for verbose) or two hyphens (`--`) for long options (e.g., `--version` to display the version of the software). Option arguments often take a value that further specifies their behavior, such as `--output filename.txt`, where `filename.txt` is the value for the `--output` option.\\n\\n2. **Non-Option Arguments**: These are the main arguments for a command that do not modify behavior but instead are usually the target of the command's action. For example, in a command like `cp source.txt destination.txt`, `source.txt` and `destination.txt` are non-option arguments specifying the source and destination of the copy operation. They are not prefixed with a hyphen.\\n\\n### Example to Illustrate the Difference:\\n\\nConsider the `ls` command used in Unix-like operating systems to list directory contents.\\n\\n- **Non-Option Argument Usage**: When you run `ls Documents`, `Documents` is a non-option argument specifying the directory whose contents you want to list. The command's action (listing) is directly applied to this argument.\\n\\n- **Option Argument Usage**: If you modify the behavior of `ls` using options, like `ls -l Documents`, the `-l` is an option argument that changes how the listing is displayed (in long format), while `Documents` remains a non-option argument specifying where the action is applied.\\n\\n### Your Context with `near-cli`:\\n\\nGiven the command you were trying to run:\\n```shell\\nnear deploy --accountId pbc2024.testnet --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm\\n```\\n- The `--accountId pbc2024.testnet` and `--wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm` parts are option arguments specifying the account to deploy to and the path to the WASM file, respectively.\\n\\nIn many CLI tools, including `near-cli`, you usually combine both types of arguments to achieve the desired command behavior, specifying both what action to take (via non-option arguments) and how to modify that action (via option arguments). However, the error you encountered suggested a syntactical expectation mismatch, which is uncommon with well-formed commands like yours, pointing towards other potential issues such as CLI version discrepancies or environmental factors."

The `near-cli` tool is interpreting the command differently than expected, leading to the \\\"Not enough non-option arguments\\\" error.\\n\\n### Understanding the Error\\n\\nThis error typically suggests that the `near-cli` is expecting a different format or structure for the command. It's possible that there has been an update or change in the way `near-cli` expects its arguments, or there might be a regional or environmental factor affecting command parsing.\\n\\nGiven the correct syntax for deploying a contract should closely resemble your command, let's explore a couple of ways to address and work around this issue:\\n\\n### Immediate Solution\\n\\nOne immediate workaround, based on the structure of your command and assuming your `near-cli` version hasn't diverged too much from common usage, is to ensure your command strictly follows the expected syntax. However, since your syntax looks correct, we might be facing an issue with how the command is interpreted.\\n\\n### Debug Steps\\n\\n1. **Ensure `near-cli` is Up-to-Date**: Outdated versions might lead to unexpected behaviors.\\n   ```bash\\n   npm install -g near-cli\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Check `near-cli` Version**: After updating, check your `near-cli` version.\\n   ```bash\\n   near --version\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Consult the Latest Documentation**: Since the `near-cli` tool might have received updates, the expected command format might have changed. Checking the [official NEAR CLI documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli) or using the `--help` flag can provide insights.\\n   ```bash\\n   near deploy --help\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Try an Alternative Syntax**: If the documentation suggests a different format or if there have been changes, try adjusting your command accordingly.\\n\\n### Alternative Command Formats\\n\\n- **Using Positional Arguments (if supported)**: Some CLI versions might support or require positional arguments for the deploy command, where the order of arguments matters, and they're not named with `--`. However, your error message suggests named arguments are expected.\\n\\n- **Specify the Network ID Explicitly**: Although it should default correctly, specifying the network might help in some cases.\\n   ```bash\\n   near deploy --wasmFile ./contract.wasm --accountId pbc2024.testnet --networkId testnet\\n   ```\\n\\n### Last Resort\\n\\nIf standard troubleshooting doesn't resolve the issue, consider reaching out for support:\\n\\n- **NEAR Community and Support Channels**: The NEAR Protocol [Discord](https://near.chat/) or the [NEAR Forum](https://gov.near.org) can be great places to seek help from the community and the developers behind `near-cli`.\\n\\n- **GitHub Issues**: If you suspect this might be a bug or an unintended change in behavior, consider checking the [NEAR CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/near-cli) for similar issues or open a new one detailing your problem, the command you're running, the expected outcome, the erroneous outcome, and your `near-cli` version.\\n\\nGiven the usual stability and backward compatibility of CLI tools, encountering such an issue might suggest an unusual situation, possibly specific to the environment, version mismatch, or even regional settings affecting command parsing."

Assuming the contract has a view method to get the list of members, you could use NEAR's JavaScript SDK to make this call. \\n\\nFirst, ensure you have the contract's account ID and know the correct method name for fetching the members. \\n\\nHere's a basic example of how you might do this using JavaScript:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst { connect, keyStores, WalletConnection } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\");\\n\\nasync function getMembers() {\\n    // Configuration for the NEAR connection\\n    const nearConfig = {\\n        networkId: \\\"mainnet\\\", // or \\\"testnet\\\"\\n        keyStore: new keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),\\n        nodeUrl: \\\"https://rpc.mainnet.near.org\\\",\\n        walletUrl: \\\"https://wallet.mainnet.near.org\\\",\\n    };\\n\\n    // Connect to NEAR\\n    const near = await connect(nearConfig);\\n    const wallet = new WalletConnection(near);\\n    \\n    // Assuming you know the contract name and the method\\n    const contractName = \\\"hzn_contract.near\\\"; // Replace with actual contract account\\n    const methodName = \\\"get_members\\\"; // Replace with the actual method name\\n\\n    // Making a contract call to get the data\\n    const members = await wallet.account().viewFunction(contractName, methodName, {});\\n    console.log(members);\\n}\\n\\ngetMembers().catch(console.error);\\n```\\n\\n2. **Blockchain Explorer**: If the project has publicly shared transactions or a smart contract deployment on the NEAR blockchain, you might find information about founders or members in the transaction details on a blockchain explorer for NEAR, like [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/). This would be more manual and less direct than querying a smart contract.\\n\\n3. **Official Project Channels**: Projects often list team members or founders on their official website, whitepaper, or social media channels. If HZN has such resources, they might explicitly list their founding members there.\\n\\nIf \\\"HZN\\\" stands for something specific not related to a project or if there\u2019s another context, could you provide more details?

This ensures that the application's UI is accessible from anywhere without relying on a single server or provider.\\n   \\n2. **Arweave**: Another option is Arweave, a service that offers permanent, tamper-proof storage for DApp front ends. It's a bit different from IPFS in that it focuses on long-term storage, ensuring that the UI remains available indefinitely.\\n\\n3. **NEAR's own solutions**: While NEAR primarily focuses on the underlying blockchain and smart contract technology, it integrates well with decentralized storage solutions for hosting UIs. The NEAR Protocol itself does not provide a decentralized storage layer specifically for UIs, but it supports and encourages using these technologies.\\n\\n### Development Tools and Frameworks:\\n\\n- **Create Near App**: For development, you might use templates like \\\"create-near-app\\\", which scaffold a NEAR project for you. This tool can set up both the smart contract backend (using Rust or AssemblyScript) and a React front-end template that you can modify for your DApp. Once developed, the front-end can then be deployed to a decentralized storage solution of your choice.\\n\\n- **NEAR SDKs**: For the front-end, NEAR offers JavaScript SDKs (`near-api-js`) that facilitate communication between your decentralized UI and the NEAR blockchain, enabling tasks such as contract interactions, wallet integration, and transaction signing.\\n\\n### Example of Decentralized UI Deployment:\\n\\n1. **Develop your DApp UI**: Typically using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For interacting with NEAR, you would use `near-api-js`.\\n\\n2. **Build and bundle your UI**: Tools like Webpack or Parcel can be used to bundle your application for production.\\n\\n3. **Deploy to decentralized storage**: Upload your bundled application to IPFS, Arweave, or another decentralized storage solution.\\n\\n4. **Access through a gateway**: Users can access your DApp UI through public gateways or directly if they have IPFS nodes or compatible browser extensions.\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\n\\nA decentralized UI for NEAR DApps ensures that the application remains accessible and resilient against censorship or centralized points of failure. By leveraging decentralized storage solutions for hosting the UI and utilizing NEAR's developer tools for blockchain interactions, developers can create fully decentralized applications that align with blockchain's core principles."

This usually happens because the Next.js package is not installed globally on your machine, or the local node_modules folder where Next.js is installed is not accessible by your shell.\\n\\nHere are a few steps to resolve this issue:\\n\\n1. **Install Next.js Locally (Recommended)**\\n   If you haven't already installed Next.js in your project, you can do so by running:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   npm install --save next react react-dom\\n   ```\\n\\n   After installing, make sure to add or update the build script in your `package.json` to use the local Next.js binary. Your build script seems to be correctly set up since it's attempting to run `next build`. This step ensures that the local version of Next.js is used.\\n\\n2. **Run Using npx**\\n   If Next.js is installed locally, you can use `npx` to run the local version of the Next.js build command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   npx next build\\n   ```\\n\\n   `npx` is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher. It can run any command available in local node_modules/.bin or from a central cache, downloading any packages if necessary.\\n\\n3. **Check Your `PATH`**\\n   If you have installed Next.js globally (`npm install -g next`), but the command is not found, your `PATH` environment variable might not include the directory where global NPM packages are installed. You can find the path to global packages by running:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   npm list -g --depth=0\\n   ```\\n\\n   Ensure that the directory listed is included in your `PATH` environment variable. The process to modify the `PATH` differs between operating systems.\\n\\n4. **Reinstall Node Modules**\\n   Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by reinstalling your `node_modules` directory. Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file (if present) and reinstall your dependencies:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json\\n   npm install\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Use a Specific Version of Next.js**\\n   If you're following a tutorial or need a specific version of Next.js, you can install that version specifically:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   npm install --save next@specific-version react react-dom\\n   ```\\n\\n   Replace `specific-version` with the version number you need.\\n\\nChoose the method that best suits your project setup and preferences. If you continue to encounter issues, providing more information about your project setup could help in diagnosing the problem further."

                "content": "This error message indicates that the build process for `node-sass` failed. This is a common issue with Node.js projects that rely on native extensions or bindings. The `node-sass` package, specifically, has been known to cause issues, especially on newer versions of Node.js or on systems where the correct build tools are not available or properly configured.\\n\\nHere's how you can address this issue:\\n\\n### 1. Install Python and Build Tools\\n\\nThe error message indicates a failure related to `node-gyp`, a tool used to compile native addon modules for Node.js. `node-gyp` requires Python and certain build tools to be available on your system:\\n\\n- **For macOS:**\\n    Ensure you have Python installed and accessible. You might also need to install Xcode Command Line Tools, which includes `gcc` and `make` among other necessary build tools. You can install them by running:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    xcode-select --install\\n    ```\\n\\n- **For Windows:**\\n    Install the windows-build-tools package globally by running:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    npm install --global windows-build-tools\\n    ```\\n\\n### 2. Use Node Version Supported by node-sass\\n\\n`node-sass` has specific Node.js version requirements. Ensure you're using a version of Node.js that is supported by the version of `node-sass` in your project. You can use `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to switch between Node.js versions. For example, to switch to Node.js version 14 (which is commonly supported by many `node-sass` versions):\\n\\n```bash\\nnvm install 14\\nnvm use 14\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Switch to Dart Sass\\n\\nGiven the deprecation of `node-sass` and the move towards Dart Sass (the primary implementation of Sass), consider migrating to `sass` (Dart Sass) if possible. Dart Sass is fully compatible with `node-sass` for most use cases and does not require native bindings, making it easier to install and more resilient across Node.js versions. You can switch by uninstalling `node-sass` and installing `sass`:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm uninstall node-sass\\nnpm install sass\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Reinstall Node Modules\\n\\nAfter making sure your environment meets the requirements or after switching to Dart Sass, remove your `node_modules` directory and any `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` files, then reinstall your dependencies:\\n\\n```bash\\nrm -rf node_modules\\nrm package-lock.json # If using npm\\nnpm install\\n# or, if using Yarn:\\n# rm yarn.lock\\n# yarn install\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Check for Deprecations and Compatibility\\n\\nThe long list of deprecated warnings suggests that your project dependencies might be outdated or using older versions that are not fully compatible with your current Node.js version. Review and update your `package.json` dependencies to their latest versions, paying special attention to those explicitly mentioned in the warnings.\\n\\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, providing more specific details about your operating system, Node.js version, and version of `node-sass` or other relevant dependencies might help diagnose the problem further."

Replace `my-first-near-app` with the name of your project:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-near-app my-first-near-app\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Explore your project**\\n\\nThe `create-near-app` command will create a new directory named after your project. It includes a frontend (React by default) and a contract directory. The contract directory is where you write your smart contracts in Rust.\\n\\n**Step 5: Write your smart contract**\\n\\nYou can write your smart contract in the `contract/src/lib.rs` file. Here's a simple Rust contract:\\n\\n```rust\\nuse near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\nuse near_sdk::{env, near_bindgen};\\n\\nnear_sdk::setup_alloc!();\\n\\n// Data model\\n#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\npub struct MyContract {\\n    pub message: String,\\n}\\n\\n#[near_bindgen]\\nimpl MyContract {\\n    #[init]\\n    pub fn new(message: String) -> Self {\\n        Self { message }\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn get_message(&self) -> String {\\n        return self.message.clone();\\n    }\\n\\n    pub fn set_message(&mut self, message: String) {\\n        self.message = message;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Step 6: Build and deploy your smart contract**\\n\\nYou can build your contract using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn build:contract\\n```\\n\\nThen deploy it using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear dev-deploy out/main.wasm\\n```\\n\\n**Step 7: Interact with your smart contract**\\n\\nNow, you can interact with your smart contract via the frontend. Update the `src/config.js` file with the account ID that was printed after deploying your contract.\\n\\nYou can then run your app locally using:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn start\\n```\\n\\nAnd that's it! You've just created your first NEAR dApp. This is a simple example and real-world dApps can be much more complex, but this should help you get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."

It allows the contract owner to create (mint) new tokens and assign them to an owner. Token owners can transfer their tokens to someone else. Anyone can check the owner of a specific token.\\n\\nPlease note that this contract doesn't fully comply with the NEP-171 standards (e.g., it doesn't implement approval functionality, doesn't emit events, etc.), but it should help you get started with NFTs on NEAR.\\n\\nOnce you've written your contract, you can compile it to WebAssembly (WASM) using the Rust compiler. You can then deploy the compiled WASM file to the NEAR testnet or mainnet using the NEAR CLI."

Let's break it down into simple steps. Remember, even if you're not a developer yet, following these steps will get you on the right path. \\n\\n### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm\\nFirst things first, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Think of Node.js as the engine that runs your code, and npm as a giant library where you can borrow code written by others.\\n\\n- **How to Install**: Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), download the latest stable version for your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux), and follow the installation instructions. npm is included when you install Node.js, so you get two tools with one download!\\n\\n### Step 2: Install Yarn (Optional but Recommended)\\nYarn is another package manager like npm but with some different features. It\u2019s like choosing between a backpack and a messenger bag for school; both do the job, but you might prefer one over the other.\\n\\n- **How to Install**: Open your terminal or command prompt and type:\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install -g yarn\\n  ```\\n\\n### Step 3: Install NEAR CLI\\nThe NEAR CLI (Command Line Interface) is your magic wand for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. You'll use it to create, test, and deploy your apps.\\n\\n- **How to Install**: In your terminal or command prompt, type:\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install -g near-cli\\n  ```\\n\\n### Step 4: Set up Your Code Editor\\nYou'll need an editor to write your code. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) is a popular, free option that works well for JavaScript and Rust (the languages used in NEAR development).\\n\\n- **How to Install**: Go to the VS Code website, download the version for your operating system, and follow the setup instructions.\\n\\n### Step 5: Install Rust (For Smart Contracts)\\nIf you're planning to write smart contracts, you'll need Rust. Smart contracts are like the rules of a game, dictating how your app interacts with the NEAR blockchain.\\n\\n- **How to Install**:\\n  1. Go to the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and follow the instructions to install Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager and build tool).\\n\\n### Step 6: Create a NEAR Account\\nTo deploy apps and interact with the NEAR blockchain, you\u2019ll need a NEAR account.\\n\\n- **How to Create an Account**: Go to the [NEAR Wallet website](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) and follow the instructions to create a new account on the testnet (a sandbox version of NEAR for testing).\\n\\n### Step 7: Start Building!\\nNow that you\u2019ve got your tools ready, you can start building your app. You might want to start with some tutorials or templates specific to NEAR development. \\n\\nRemember, building something new can be challenging, but it's also exciting and rewarding. Take it step by step, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Good luck!"

                "content": "If you're leaning towards using JavaScript as much as possible for your NEAR app development, the good news is that much of the setup remains the same with a few tweaks. JavaScript can be used to write your frontend application and interact with smart contracts. However, the creation of smart contracts themselves on NEAR is primarily done using Rust. That being said, you can still focus on JavaScript for a significant portion of your development work. Let's adjust the steps to focus on this preference:\\n\\n### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm\\nThis step remains unchanged. Node.js and npm are essential for JavaScript development, including installing packages and running your project.\\n\\n### Step 2: Install Yarn (Optional but Recommended)\\nAlso unchanged. Yarn is an alternative to npm and works well for managing your JavaScript project dependencies.\\n\\n### Step 3: Install NEAR CLI\\nThis step is crucial and remains unchanged. NEAR CLI will be your primary tool for deploying contracts and interacting with the NEAR blockchain, whether your contracts are written in Rust or AssemblyScript (a language similar to TypeScript, for writing smart contracts).\\n\\n### Step 4: Set up Your Code Editor\\nNo change here. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a great option for JavaScript development, offering excellent support for JavaScript and various extensions to make your development smoother.\\n\\n### Skipping Rust Installation\\nIf you're focusing on JavaScript, you might opt not to install Rust immediately. However, if you plan to write or modify smart contracts later, you might need to revisit this. You can use AssemblyScript for smart contracts to stay closer to JavaScript syntax, but it's worth noting that Rust is more commonly used for NEAR smart contracts and might offer better support and performance for complex applications.\\n\\n### Additional Steps for JavaScript Developers:\\n\\n#### Install AssemblyScript Compiler (If writing smart contracts with it)\\nIf you decide to write smart contracts in a language that's more familiar to JavaScript developers, you might choose AssemblyScript.\\n\\n- **How to Install**:\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install -g assemblyscript\\n  ```\\n\\n#### Focus on Learning JavaScript/TypeScript NEAR SDK\\nNEAR has SDKs (Software Development Kits) that facilitate the development process. For JavaScript, focusing on understanding and using `near-api-js` is crucial. This library allows you to interact with the NEAR blockchain, including smart contracts.\\n\\n- **How to Get Started**:\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install near-api-js\\n  ```\\n\\n  Familiarizing yourself with `near-api-js` through documentation and examples will be incredibly beneficial. It'll be your primary toolkit for connecting your JavaScript frontend with the NEAR blockchain.\\n\\n### Summary\\nBy focusing on JavaScript, you streamline your development process around ecosystems you're familiar with. JavaScript can handle much of the interaction layer with your app, but remember, for smart contracts, AssemblyScript is an option that feels similar to TypeScript, keeping you in a comfortable development zone. Keep in mind that depending on your project's needs, learning Rust might become beneficial, especially for complex or performance-critical smart contracts. Follow the NEAR documentation and tutorials for `near-api-js` and AssemblyScript (if you go that route) to start building your app effectively."

Let's get you started on building your first NEAR app. Given your interest in using JavaScript as much as possible, we'll focus on creating a simple app that interacts with a smart contract on the NEAR blockchain. This guide will walk you through creating a NEAR account, setting up a project, writing a simple smart contract (we'll touch upon Rust briefly, but the focus will be on the JavaScript side), and interacting with that contract through a web interface.\\n\\n**Step 1: Ensure Your Development Environment is Set Up**\\n\\nMake sure Node.js, npm (or Yarn), and NEAR CLI are installed as per the previous instructions.\\n\\n**Step 2: Create a NEAR Testnet Account**\\n\\nIf you haven't already, create a testnet account on NEAR. Go to the [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) and follow the account creation process.\\n\\n**Step 3: Set Up Your Project**\\n\\n1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\\n   ```bash\\n   mkdir near-sample-app\\n   cd near-sample-app\\n   ```\\n   \\n2. Initialize a new Node.js project:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm init -y\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Install `near-api-js` to interact with the NEAR blockchain:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm install near-api-js\\n   ```\\n\\n4. For the frontend, let's keep it simple. You can use HTML and vanilla JavaScript. Create an `index.html` and a `main.js` file in your project directory.\\n\\n**Step 4: Write a Simple Smart Contract**\\n\\nWhile our focus is on JavaScript, let's briefly touch on a simple Rust smart contract for this example. Don't worry; it's a basic example.\\n\\n1. Install Rust if you haven't yet, as per the instructions in a previous step.\\n\\n2. Create a new directory named `contract` within your project and navigate into it:\\n   ```bash\\n   mkdir contract && cd contract\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Initialize a new Rust project:\\n   ```bash\\n   cargo init --lib\\n   ```\\n\\n4. Replace the contents of `src/lib.rs` with a simple contract. For example, a counter contract:\\n   ```rust\\n   use near_sdk::near_bindgen;\\n   use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};\\n\\n   #[near_bindgen]\\n   #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]\\n   pub struct Counter {\\n       count: i32,\\n   }\\n\\n   #[near_bindgen]\\n   impl Counter {\\n       pub fn get_count(&self) -> i32 {\\n           self.count\\n       }\\n\\n       pub fn increment(&mut self) {\\n           self.count += 1;\\n       }\\n\\n       pub fn decrement(&mut self) {\\n           self.count -= 1;\\n       }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n5. Add `near-sdk` to `Cargo.toml`:\\n   ```toml\\n   [dependencies]\\n   near-sdk = \\\"3.1.0\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n6. Compile your contract:\\n   ```bash\\n   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n   ```\\n\\n**Step 5: Deploy Your Smart Contract**\\n\\n1. Log in to your NEAR account via NEAR CLI:\\n   ```bash\\n   near login\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Deploy your compiled contract (from the `contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory) to the testnet:\\n   ```bash\\n   near deploy --wasmFile path/to/your_contract.wasm --accountId your.testnet_account\\n   ```\\n\\n**Step 6: Interact with Your Contract through the Web Interface**\\n\\n1. In your `main.js`, use `near-api-js` to connect to NEAR, sign in, call contract methods, etc. Here's a very simplified example to get you started:\\n   ```javascript\\n   const { connect, WalletConnection } = require(\\\"near-api-js\\\");\\n\\n   async function initContract() {\\n       const near = await connect({\\n           networkId: \\\"testnet\\\",\\n           keyStore: new nearAPI.keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),\\n           nodeUrl: \\\"https://rpc.testnet.near.org\\\",\\n           walletUrl: \\\"https://wallet.testnet.near.org\\\",\\n       });\\n\\n       window.wallet = new WalletConnection(near);\\n       window.contract = await new Contract(wallet.account(), \\\"your.testnet_account\\\", {\\n           viewMethods: [\\\"get_count\\\"],\\n           changeMethods: [\\\"increment\\\", \\\"decrement\\\"],\\n       });\\n   }\\n\\n   async function incrementCounter() {\\n       await contract.increment();\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. In your `index.html`, add buttons to interact with your contract and display the count. Use JavaScript to update the UI based on contract interactions.\\n\\n**Step 7: Test Your Application**\\n\\nFinally, open your `index.html` in a browser and test interacting with your NEAR smart contract through the buttons. Remember, this is a simplified example to get you started. NEAR offers a rich ecosystem for building sophisticated apps, so explore the official documentation and tutorials to expand your project further.\\n\\nCongratulations, you've taken your first steps into NEAR development!"

This wallet is specifically for the testnet, where you can experiment without using real funds.\\n\\n### Step 2: Create a New Account\\n\\nClick on the **\\\"Create Account\\\"** button to start the process of creating a new account.\\n\\n### Step 3: Choose Your Account ID\\n\\nYou will be prompted to choose an account ID. This ID will also serve as your account name (e.g., `yourname.testnet`). The `.testnet` suffix is added automatically to signify that this is a testnet account.\\n\\n### Step 4: Secure Your Account\\n\\nNext, you will need to select a method for securing your account. Options typically include using a Ledger hardware wallet, a passphrase, or a recovery link sent via email. For most developers, selecting the email option or passphrase method is convenient and secure enough for testnet purposes.\\n\\n### Step 5: Confirm Your Account\\n\\n- If you chose the email method, follow the instructions sent to your email to confirm the account creation.\\n- If you selected the passphrase method, make sure to save your passphrase in a secure location. You'll need it to access your account.\\n\\n### Step 6: Account Creation Complete\\n\\nOnce the process is complete, and you have secured your account, you will be directed back to the testnet wallet dashboard, where you can see your new account and your testnet NEAR balance.\\n\\n### Step 7: Funding Your Account\\n\\nNewly created testnet accounts are usually automatically funded with a small amount of testnet NEAR tokens, which you can use to deploy contracts and interact with the blockchain. If you need more tokens for testing, the process might involve specific faucets or community programs provided by NEAR for developers.\\n\\n### Additional Steps for Developers\\n\\n- **Install NEAR CLI:** For a smoother development experience, consider installing the NEAR Command Line Interface (CLI). This tool allows you to interact with the NEAR blockchain directly from your terminal. Install it via npm:\\n  ```bash\\n  npm install -g near-cli\\n  ```\\n- **Development:** With your account set up, you can begin developing your applications. You might want to start by cloning examples, deploying simple smart contracts, or experimenting with NEAR's features.\\n\\n- **Documentation and Resources:** NEAR has extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources available to help you get started with development. Make sure to explore these resources to learn more about what you can do on the NEAR platform.\\n\\nCreating a developer account on NEAR's testnet is your gateway to building and testing applications on a cutting-edge blockchain platform.

In your case, it seems like the command format used by the `npm run deploy` script in your `package.json` file doesn't match the expected format required by the NEAR CLI tool.\\n\\nAs per the NEAR CLI tool's output, the correct syntax for deploying a contract includes specifying both the `<account-id>` and the `<wasm-file>` as positional arguments. However, your command seems to use the older syntax, where the `--accountId` and `--wasmFile` options are used to specify these values.\\n\\nTo fix this issue, you can update the `deploy` script in your `package.json` file to match the expected syntax. The updated command should look like this:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"deploy\\\": \\\"near deploy menopausey.testnet build/hello-near.wasm\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis command assumes that `menopausey.testnet` is your account ID on the NEAR testnet and `build/hello-near.wasm` is the path to your compiled smart contract WebAssembly (WASM) file.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\\n\\n- Removed the `--wasmFile` and `--accountId` options.\\n- Placed `menopausey.testnet` (the account ID) and `build/hello-near.wasm` (the path to the WASM file) directly after `near deploy` as positional arguments, in accordance with the updated NEAR CLI syntax.\\n\\nAfter making this change, try running `npm run deploy` again. This should correctly deploy your smart contract to the specified NEAR account.\\n\\nRemember to double-check the path to your WASM file and ensure that your NEAR CLI is up-to-date to avoid any syntax mismatches. You can update the NEAR CLI tool by running `npm install -g near-cli` in your terminal."

This typically happens for one of two reasons:\\n\\n1. **The WASM file hasn't been compiled yet**: Before deploying, you need to compile your smart contract into a WebAssembly (WASM) file. Ensure you've compiled your smart contract correctly and that the output `.wasm` file is located in the expected directory.\\n\\n2. **The path to the WASM file is incorrect**: If you've already compiled the smart contract, the issue might be that the path specified in the deploy command doesn't correctly point to where the `.wasm` file is located.\\n\\n### How to Fix\\n\\n**If the WASM file hasn't been compiled:**\\n\\n- Ensure you're in the root directory of your smart contract project.\\n- Compile your smart contract. The exact command depends on whether you're using AssemblyScript or Rust for your smart contract development.\\n\\n  - **For AssemblyScript**: Typically, you would use a command like `npm run asb` if using the AssemblyScript compiler provided in the NEAR examples.\\n  - **For Rust**: Use the Rust compiler command, which usually looks like `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`. The output `.wasm` file will be located in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` directory within your Rust project.\\n\\n**If the path to the WASM file is incorrect:**\\n\\n- Double-check the directory structure of your project to locate the `.wasm` file. If the `build` directory or the `.wasm` file isn't where you expected, you may need to adjust the path in your deploy command.\\n- If you've compiled the smart contract but can't find where the output `.wasm` file is, rerun the compile command and pay close attention to the output in your terminal; it should indicate where the file is being saved.\\n\\n**Example of Correcting Path:**\\n\\nSuppose your `.wasm` file is actually located at `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_near.wasm` (common for Rust projects). In that case, your deploy command should be adjusted to:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy menopausey.testnet target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_near.wasm\\n```\\n\\n**General Tips:**\\n\\n- Always ensure you're running commands from the correct directory within your project.\\n- Paths are relative to the directory from which you run the NEAR CLI command.\\n- If you move your `.wasm` file, remember to update the path in any scripts or commands that reference it.\\n\\nAfter ensuring the `.wasm` file exists and the path is correctly specified in your deploy command, try running the command again."

Here are a few common reasons why this error might occur and how to fix them:\\n\\n### 1. Incorrect Relative Path\\n\\n- **Problem:** The relative path might be incorrect because the `build` directory is not located as expected relative to the current working directory.\\n- **Solution:** Double-check the actual location of your `hello-near.wasm` file. You may need to adjust the path in your `deploy` script within `package.json` to accurately reflect the file\u2019s location.\\n\\n### 2. WASM File Has Not Been Compiled or Moved\\n\\n- **Problem:** The WASM file hasn't been compiled yet, or if it was compiled, it might have been moved from its expected location.\\n- **Solution:** Ensure you have compiled your smart contract and that the output file (`hello-near.wasm`) exists in the specified location. For Rust contracts, this usually involves running a build command similar to `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` and then moving the compiled `.wasm` file to your designated `build` directory, if necessary.\\n\\n### 3. Running Command from Wrong Directory\\n\\n- **Problem:** You might be running the `npm run deploy` command from a directory different than expected, causing the relative path to point incorrectly.\\n- **Solution:** Verify your current directory by running `pwd` (print working directory) in the terminal. Ensure that when you run `npm run deploy`, your current directory is such that the relative path `../build/hello-near.wasm` correctly points to the WASM file.\\n\\n### How to Fix\\n\\n1. **Verify the Location of the WASM File:**\\n   - Locate where your WASM file is generated. If you are unsure, recompile your smart contract and note the output path.\\n\\n2. **Update the Path in `package.json` (if necessary):**\\n   - If the WASM file is in a different location than what your `deploy` script expects, update the script with the correct path to the WASM file.\\n\\nFor example, if your WASM file is actually in the `build` directory inside your project (not one directory up), the path in your `deploy` script should be `\\\"build/hello-near.wasm\\\"` instead of `\\\"../build/hello-near.wasm\\\"`.\\n\\n3. **Run the Deploy Command Again:**\\n   - After confirming the WASM file\u2019s location and ensuring the path is correct in your `deploy` script, run `npm run deploy` again.\\n\\nRemember, paths are relative to the current directory from which you are executing the command. Adjusting your current directory or the specified path in the command should resolve the error."

                "content": "To compile a smart contract into a WebAssembly (WASM) file, like `hello-near.wasm`, you need to know the programming language the contract is written in. For NEAR smart contracts, Rust and AssemblyScript are commonly used. Below are the steps for compiling smart contracts written in both languages to a `.wasm` file.\\n\\n### If Your Contract is Written in Rust\\n\\n1. **Install Rust:**\\n   Make sure you have Rust and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed. If not, you can install Rust from [the official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). After installing Rust, add the WebAssembly compilation target using the command:\\n   ```bash\\n   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Compile the Contract:**\\n   Navigate to the directory containing your Rust project (where the `Cargo.toml` file is). Compile the contract with the following command:\\n   ```bash\\n   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n   ```\\n   \\n   Your compiled `.wasm` file will be located in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`.\\n\\n3. **(Optional) Optimize Your WASM File:**\\n   For deploying on NEAR, it's common to further optimize the `.wasm` file size using `wasm-opt` from the [Binaryen toolkit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). Install `wasm-opt` and run it on your `.wasm` file:\\n   ```bash\\n   wasm-opt -Oz -o hello-near-opt.wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_near.wasm\\n   ```\\n   \\n   This step is optional but recommended for production contracts to minimize resource usage.\\n\\n### If Your Contract is Written in AssemblyScript\\n\\n1. **Setup AssemblyScript Compiler:**\\n   If you haven't already set up the AssemblyScript compiler (`asc`), you can do so by adding it to your project:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm install --save-dev assemblyscript\\n   ```\\n   \\n   Initialize a new AssemblyScript project if you haven\u2019t already by running:\\n   ```bash\\n   npx asinit .\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Compile the Contract:**\\n   Make sure your AssemblyScript source code (typically `assembly/index.ts` for NEAR projects) is ready. Compile the AssemblyScript into a `.wasm` file using the command:\\n   ```bash\\n   npm run asbuild\\n   ```\\n   \\n   Or, if you prefer to invoke the AssemblyScript compiler directly:\\n   ```bash\\n   npx asc assembly/index.ts --target release -o build/hello-near.wasm\\n   ```\\n   \\n   Adjust the paths as necessary for your project's structure. The output will be in the `build` directory or whichever output directory you specify.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n\\n- After compiling your `.wasm` file, you can proceed to deploy it to the NEAR testnet or mainnet using the `near-cli` tools, as you attempted in your previous questions.\\n- Remember to replace `hello-near.wasm` with the path to your actual compiled `.wasm` file when deploying.\\n\\nThis guide assumes you have a basic setup for Rust or AssemblyScript development. For more detailed instructions, especially for configuring and optimizing your environment, refer to the official NEAR documentation and the respective language guides."

Here's a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n### 1. Enable WSL on Windows\\n\\nFirst, you need to enable WSL on your Windows machine. You can do this by opening PowerShell as Administrator and running the following command:\\n\\n```powershell\\nwsl --install\\n```\\n\\nThis command will enable the required optional components, download the latest Linux kernel, set WSL 2 as your default, and install a Linux distribution for you (Ubuntu by default).\\n\\nIf you're on an earlier version of Windows 10, you might need to manually enable WSL and install a Linux distribution. Check the detailed guide on Microsoft's documentation for that: [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)\\n\\n### 2. Set up a New Linux Distribution (if necessary)\\n\\nAfter enabling WSL, you can choose to install a different Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. Just search for your preferred distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora) and click \\\"Get\\\" to install it.\\n\\n### 3. Initialize and Update Your Linux Distribution\\n\\nOnce installed, launch your Linux distribution from the Start menu. Upon the first launch, it might take a few minutes to set up. You'll be prompted to create a user account and password for your Linux distribution.\\n\\nAfter setting up your account, update your package list and upgrade the packages by running:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Install Node.js on Linux\\n\\nNow, you need to install Node.js in your Linux environment. You can install Node.js using a package manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) which allows you to switch between Node versions easily. Here\u2019s how to install `nvm` and then use it to install Node.js:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\\n```\\n\\nRestart your terminal, and then install Node.js:\\n\\n```bash\\nnvm install node\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Run `npx create-near-app`\\n\\nWith Node.js installed, you can now run `npx create-near-app` in your Linux distribution:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-near-app@latest\\n```\\n\\nThis command will scaffold a new NEAR project for you to start developing.\\n\\n### Additional Tips\\n\\n- **Accessing Windows Files from Linux**: Your Windows filesystem is accessible from Linux in the `/mnt/` directory. For example, `C:` drive is available at `/mnt/c/`.\\n- **Using Visual Studio Code with WSL**: If you're using VS Code, you can seamlessly develop inside WSL by installing the Remote - WSL extension. This allows you to open any folder in WSL and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set.\\n\\nThis should give you a comprehensive start to using WSL for NEAR development on Windows.

For example, to go to your `C:` drive, you would type:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /mnt/c/\\n```\\n\\n4. From here, you can navigate to any folder within your `C:` drive using standard Linux commands. For instance, if you have a folder named `Code` in your user directory, you can access it like so (replace `YourUserName` with your actual Windows username):\\n\\n```bash\\ncd /mnt/c/Users/YourUserName/Code/\\n```\\n\\n5. If you want to see the files and folders within the current directory, type:\\n\\n```bash\\nls\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Tips:\\n\\n- **Creating and Editing Files**: You can create files using `touch` (e.g., `touch example.txt`) and edit them with text editors available in your Linux environment, like `nano` (e.g., `nano example.txt`).\\n- **Copying and Moving Files**: Use `cp` to copy files and `mv` to move or rename them. Remember, file paths will look a bit different in WSL, with Windows drives under `/mnt/`.\\n- **Accessing Linux Files from Windows**: In Windows Explorer, you can access your Linux files by typing `\\\\\\\\wsl$` in the address bar. You\u2019ll see your installed Linux distributions, and you can navigate their file systems.\\n\\nUsing WSL effectively bridges the gap between Windows and Linux development environments, allowing you to use powerful Linux tools directly on Windows."

                "content": "It seems like the `create-near-app` command is mistakenly identifying your WSL environment as a native Windows environment, which is unusual. This issue could potentially be caused by how `npx` or Node.js detects the operating system environment, specifically within the context of WSL.\\n\\nLet's try a couple of approaches to work around this issue:\\n\\n### Approach 1: Explicitly Use Node.js and npm Installed in WSL\\n\\nFirst, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed within your WSL environment and not just on the Windows side. You can check if Node.js is installed and its version by running:\\n\\n```bash\\nnode -v\\n```\\n\\nAnd for npm:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm -v\\n```\\n\\nIf Node.js is not installed, you can install it using `nvm`, the Node Version Manager, which allows for easy installation and management of Node.js versions:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\\n# Restart your terminal and then:\\nnvm install node\\n```\\n\\nOnce confirmed, try running the `create-near-app` command again from your project directory within `/mnt/c/Users/seanw/Code/Graffito/pbc24/near`.\\n\\n### Approach 2: Install and Run Locally Without npx\\n\\nAnother approach is to install `create-near-app` globally and then run it, which might bypass the issue:\\n\\n1. Install `create-near-app` globally:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g create-near-app@latest\\n```\\n\\n2. After installation, navigate to the desired directory where you wish to create your new app and run:\\n\\n```bash\\ncreate-near-app your-project-name\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-project-name` with the name of your new project. This will create a new NEAR project in the specified directory.\\n\\n### Approach 3: Manual Clone from the GitHub Repository\\n\\nAs a last resort, if the issue persists, you can manually clone the `create-near-app` repository and set up your project:\\n\\n1. Clone the `create-near-app` repository:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/near/create-near-app.git\\n```\\n\\n2. Navigate into the cloned directory, and run the setup script for a new project:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd create-near-app\\n./scripts/setup-template.sh your-project-name\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-project-name` with your desired project name. This script initializes a new project based on the `create-near-app` template.\\n\\n### Additional Tip\\n\\n- **Environment Variables**: Sometimes, explicitly setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `linux` within WSL can help with OS detection issues. You can set this temporarily with `export NODE_ENV=linux` before running commands.\\n\\nIf none of these approaches resolve the issue, it might be helpful to check the system's configurations or consider updating both your WSL and Node.js/npm installations to their latest versions, as there might be fixes available in newer releases."

                "content": "Creating a full-stack NEAR app with a Rust smart contract backend and a React.js frontend involves several key steps. Below is an outline of the process from setup to deployment.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore you start, make sure you have the following installed:\\n- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)\\n- Rust with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target\\n- NEAR CLI\\n- Git\\n\\n### Step 1: Scaffold a New NEAR Project\\n\\n1. **Scaffold your project** using `create-near-app`. This tool provides a quick start for building NEAR applications. Since you're using WSL and have Node.js installed, run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-near-app@latest your-project-name --frontend=react --contract=rust\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-project-name` with the name of your project. This command creates a new NEAR project with a React.js frontend and a Rust contract template.\\n\\n### Step 2: Develop Your Rust Smart Contract\\n\\n2. **Navigate to your project directory** and find the Rust contract in the `contract` folder. Open it in your preferred code editor.\\n\\n```bash\\ncd your-project-name/contract\\n```\\n\\n3. **Develop your smart contract** in Rust. The template provides a simple example to get started. Modify the contract to fit your application's needs.\\n\\n4. **Compile your smart contract** to WebAssembly (WASM) using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\n5. **Deploy your smart contract** to the NEAR testnet (or mainnet, depending on your stage of development). First, make sure you have created a NEAR account. Then, use the NEAR CLI to deploy:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_contract.wasm --accountId your-account.testnet\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your_contract.wasm` with the path to your compiled WASM file and `your-account.testnet` with your NEAR account.\\n\\n### Step 3: Develop Your React.js Frontend\\n\\n6. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd ../frontend\\n```\\n\\n7. **Customize the React application** to interact with your smart contract. The `create-near-app` scaffold provides boilerplate code to get you started, including initializing NEAR API and invoking contract methods.\\n\\n8. **Run your React app** locally to test the interaction with your deployed smart contract:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run start\\n```\\n\\nThis will start a development server, and you should be able to view your app by navigating to `http://localhost:1234` in your web browser.\\n\\n### Step 4: Deploy Your Frontend\\n\\n9. Once you're ready to deploy your React application, you can build it for production:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run build\\n```\\n\\n10. **Deploy your static files** to a hosting service. There are many options available like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3. The specific steps will depend on the service you choose.\\n\\n### Additional Tips:\\n\\n- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Use the NEAR SDK for Rust to access blockchain features and the NEAR JavaScript API for frontend interactions.\\n- **Testing**: Write unit tests for your Rust contracts and integration tests for your frontend.\\n- **Version Control**: Regularly commit your changes to Git to track the development progress.\\n\\nThis outline gives you a high-level overview of creating a full-stack NEAR application with a Rust smart contract backend and a React.js frontend. Each step can be expanded upon with more detailed information specific to the requirements of your application."

Since your project includes Rust smart contracts, you have the NEAR CLI installed, and you already have a testnet account, we can proceed with deploying your project to the NEAR TestNet. Here's a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n### 1. Compile Your Smart Contract\\n\\nFirst, ensure your Rust smart contract is ready to be compiled. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and use the following command to compile your contract. This will generate a WebAssembly (`.wasm`) file which is what we'll deploy to the NEAR TestNet.\\n\\n```bash\\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release\\n```\\n\\nThe compiled `.wasm` file will be located in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`. Ensure you note the name of the `.wasm` file generated.\\n\\n### 2. Log in to Your NEAR TestNet Account via CLI\\n\\nIf you haven't already logged in to your NEAR testnet account through the CLI, do it by running:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear login\\n```\\n\\nThis command will open a new browser window asking you to log in with your NEAR wallet and authorize the NEAR CLI. Follow the instructions on the screen.\\n\\n### 3. Deploy Your Smart Contract\\n\\nTo deploy your smart contract, use the `near deploy` command, specifying:\\n- Your account ID on the testnet (e.g., `your-account.testnet`)\\n- The path to your compiled `.wasm` file\\n\\n```bash\\nnear deploy --accountId your-account.testnet --wasmFile path/to/your_compiled_contract.wasm\\n```\\n\\nReplace `your-account.testnet` with your actual testnet account name and `path/to/your_compiled_contract.wasm` with the path to your compiled `.wasm` file.\\n\\n### 4. Verify Deployment\\n\\nAfter deploying, you can verify that your contract is successfully deployed by calling a view method (a method that does not change state) on your contract. The command will look something like this:\\n\\n```bash\\nnear view your-account.testnet get_some_data '{}'\\n```\\n\\nReplace `get_some_data` with an actual view method from your smart contract and `your-account.testnet` with your testnet account name.\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n\\n- Make sure your account has enough NEAR tokens to cover the deployment gas fees. You can get free NEAR tokens for testing purposes from the [NEAR TestNet Faucet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/).\\n- Always test your smart contract thoroughly in a test environment before considering deploying it to the mainnet.\\n\\nIf you encounter any issues or have specific questions about any of the steps, feel free to ask!"
